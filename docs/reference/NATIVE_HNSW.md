# Native HNSW Implementation

`VelesDB` includes a **custom native HNSW implementation** — VelesDB's single native HNSW implementation (no pluggable backends) since v1.0.

> **🎉 v1.0**: `hnsw_rs` dependency **completely removed**. Native HNSW is now the only implementation.

## Performance

*Benchmarked March 20, 2026 — Intel Core i9-14900KF, 64GB DDR5, Windows 11, Rust 1.92.0*

| Operation | Native HNSW | External libs | Improvement |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|-------------|
| **Search (100 queries)** | 26.9 ms | ~32 ms | **1.2x faster** ✅ |
| **Parallel Insert (5k)** | 1.47 s | ~1.6 s | **1.07x faster** ✅ |
| **Recall** | ~99% | baseline | Parity ✓ |

> **Key insight**: Native HNSW excels at **search operations** — the most critical path for production workloads.

## Usage (v1.0+)

No feature flags needed. Native HNSW is the only implementation:

```toml
[dependencies]
velesdb-core = "6.0.0"
```

## API

When enabled, `NativeHnswIndex` is exported alongside the standard `HnswIndex`:

```rust
use velesdb_core::index::hnsw::NativeHnswIndex;
use velesdb_core::DistanceMetric;

// Create index
let index = NativeHnswIndex::new(768, DistanceMetric::Cosine);

// Insert vectors
index.insert(1, &vec![0.1; 768]);
index.insert_batch(&[(2, vec![0.2; 768]), (3, vec![0.3; 768])]);

// Search
let results = index.search(&query, 10);

// Persistence
index.save("./my_index")?;
let loaded = NativeHnswIndex::load("./my_index", 768, DistanceMetric::Cosine)?;
```

#### `.vectors` on-disk layout

| bytes | field |
|---|---|
| 0..4 | format version, `u32` LE |
| 4..12 | vector count, `u64` LE |
| 12..16 | dimension, `u32` LE |
| 16..*data_offset* | reserved, zero-filled (v2 only) |
| *data_offset*.. | `count * dimension` values, `f32` LE |

`data_offset` is **16 in v1** and **4096 in v2**. Both versions are read; only
v2 is written.

The v2 gap is not padding for its own sake. The graph's f32 arena hands out
`&[f32]` built with `slice::from_raw_parts`, whose contract requires proper
alignment, so a payload starting at byte 16 could never be mapped as one. v2
moves it to a page boundary, which is the precondition for retiring the
duplicate arena copy entirely (#2173). Until a later version claims part of the
gap for header fields, it is zero-filled so that version can tell an unset field
from a set one.

The payload is explicitly little-endian on every target — `.vectors` is
portable, unlike the native-endian arena file beside it, and anything that later
maps it directly inherits that constraint and must gate on `target_endian`.

**Compatibility runs one way.** A current binary reads v1 and v2; a binary from
before v2 rejects a v2 file with `Unsupported version: 2`. Downgrading past this
change therefore requires re-persisting the index.

#### The file may be the arena

Since #2173 a v2 `.vectors` is mapped directly as the graph's f32 arena instead
of being read into a second buffer, when three conditions hold:

1. the file is v2, so its payload starts page-aligned;
2. the target is little-endian, matching the payload's declared byte order;
3. the store holds at least `ContiguousVectors::MIN_ARENA_CAPACITY` vectors.

The third is not a performance threshold. Below it an arena is sized up to that
floor and the file grows to match, so adoption would *write* — and **opening a
collection must never write to it**, because `velesdb-memory`'s migration resume
proves a source store unchanged by hashing these files.

Anything outside those conditions falls back to a disposable arena and the copy
path, with a warning. A mapped arena is an optimisation, never a requirement: a
filesystem that refuses the mapping costs the optimisation and nothing else.

Two consequences worth knowing when reading this code:

- A graph that adopted `.vectors` holds **no `ArenaHome`**. `ArenaHome::drop`
  removes its file unconditionally, so the durable store is protected by the
  absence of a home rather than by a flag telling it not to delete.
- `save()` does not truncate an adopted file. It flushes the mapped pages, then
  rewrites the header in place — pages before header, so a reader never sees a
  header claiming more vectors than the file holds.

#### Load-time validation (untrusted file safety)

A persisted index is treated as **untrusted input**. `load` validates the
`.graph` file against the trusted vector `count` (read from the `.vectors` file)
**before** any node ID can reach the search hot path, which uses `get_unchecked`
on the contiguous vector buffer. All of the following are checked once at load
and a violation is rejected with `InvalidData`:

- Graph header `count_check` must equal the vector `count` (mismatched
  `.graph` / `.vectors` files are rejected).
- `entry_point < count` (when `count > 0`).
- Every neighbor ID is `< count`.
- `num_neighbors` per node is capped (`MAX_NEIGHBORS_PER_NODE`), and node
  iteration is bounded by the **remaining file length** (each node serializes at
  least a 4-byte length), not a static ceiling — so a corrupt length field
  cannot drive an unbounded allocation.
- The `.vectors` header `(count, dimension)` is validated to fit within the
  actual file size before any pointer cast.

Because these invariants are established at load, the release-mode
`get_unchecked` reads during search are provably in-bounds (closing the
out-of-bounds-read class for a tampered index). See
[SOUNDNESS.md](../SOUNDNESS.md#hnsw-graph-unsafe-operations) and
[STORAGE_FORMAT.md](../STORAGE_FORMAT.md#load-time-validation-of-persisted-artifacts).

## Batch Insert Internals

### Two-Phase Allocation

`allocate_batch()` uses two separate lock scopes to minimize write-lock
contention on vector storage:

1. **`reserve_vector_capacity()`** (cold path): Acquires a write lock,
   initializes storage if needed, and pre-reserves capacity for the entire
   batch. This may trigger a buffer resize (reallocation), but it happens
   at most once per batch.
2. **`bulk_push_vectors()`** (hot path): Acquires a write lock and performs
   a bulk `push_batch()` into the pre-reserved space. No reallocation
   occurs, so the lock is held only for fast memcpy operations.

### Graduated ef_construction

For batches >= 1000 vectors, `BatchEfSchedule` applies a 3-phase VAMANA/
DiskANN-inspired schedule that reduces total construction work while
preserving graph quality:

- **Scaffold** (first 10%): Full `ef_construction` -- builds a high-quality
  backbone that guides subsequent insertions.
- **Bulk** (middle 80%): 0.5x `ef_construction` -- leverages the existing
  scaffold for efficient navigation with reduced candidate evaluation.
- **Finalize** (last 10%): 0.75x `ef_construction` -- restores edge quality
  at the graph periphery.

All reduced ef values are floored at `2 * M` to ensure the candidate pool
is never smaller than the number of neighbors to select.

### Lock-Free Entry-Point Promotion

Entry-point updates use atomic CAS (`compare_exchange`) instead of a mutex.
Two CAS operations handle the two cases:

1. **Empty index**: CAS on `entry_point` from `NO_ENTRY_POINT` to the
   inserting node's ID.
2. **Layer promotion**: CAS on `max_layer` to claim the new maximum,
   then store the new `entry_point`.

This eliminates a serialization point during concurrent batch insert.
Entry-point promotion is rare (O(log_M(N)) times per index lifetime).

## Dual-Precision Search

For even higher performance, VelesDB includes a **dual-precision HNSW** implementation:

```rust
use velesdb_core::index::hnsw::native::DualPrecisionHnsw;

// `new` returns `Result` — propagation with `?` is mandatory.
let mut hnsw = DualPrecisionHnsw::new(distance, 768, 32, 200, 100_000)?;

// Insert vectors (quantizer trains automatically after 1000 vectors).
// `insert` returns `Result<NodeId>`.
for (_id, vec) in vectors {
    let _node_id = hnsw.insert(&vec)?;
}

// Search with dual-precision (graph traversal + exact rerank).
// `search` returns `Vec<(NodeId, f32)>` — no `Result`.
let results = hnsw.search(&query, 10, 128);
```

### How It Works

1. **Graph Traversal**: Uses SIMD-accelerated float32 distances
2. **Re-ranking**: Computes exact float32 distances for final results
3. **Result**: Fast exploration + accurate final ranking

## RaBitQ Backend

VelesDB supports an optional **RaBitQ backend** that uses binary graph traversal for 32x memory bandwidth reduction during search, with exact float32 re-ranking for final results.

### `HnswBackend` Enum

`NativeHnswInner` selects the backend at construction time via the `HnswBackend` enum:

```rust
enum HnswBackend {
    /// Standard f32 distance backend (NativeHnsw<CachedSimdDistance>).
    Standard(NativeHnsw<CachedSimdDistance>),
    /// RaBitQ binary traversal + f32 re-ranking backend (boxed to avoid
    /// inflating the Standard variant's cache-line footprint).
    RaBitQ(Box<RaBitQPrecisionHnsw<CachedSimdDistance>>),
}
```

- **`Standard`**: Full f32 distances for both traversal and results. Default for `StorageMode::Full`.
- **`RaBitQ`**: Binary distances (XOR + popcount) for graph traversal, f32 re-ranking for final results. Activated by `StorageMode::RaBitQ`.

### Enabling RaBitQ

Set `StorageMode::RaBitQ` when creating a collection:

```rust
use velesdb_core::{Database, DistanceMetric, StorageMode};

let db = Database::open("./data")?;
db.create_collection_with_options(
    "documents",
    768,
    DistanceMetric::Cosine,
    StorageMode::RaBitQ,
)?;
```

**CLI**:

```bash
velesdb-cli collection create ./data documents \
  --dimension 768 \
  --metric cosine \
  --storage rabitq
```

**REST API**:

```json
POST /collections
{
  "name": "documents",
  "dimension": 768,
  "metric": "cosine",
  "storage_mode": "rabitq"
}
```

### Architecture

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│               RaBitQPrecisionHnsw<D>                         │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  inner: NativeHnsw<D>          (graph structure + float32)   │
│  rabitq_index: RaBitQIndex     (rotation matrix + centroid)  │
│  rabitq_store: RaBitQVectorStore  (bits + corrections)       │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

`RaBitQPrecisionHnsw<D>` wraps `NativeHnsw<D>` and adds a RaBitQ quantizer and binary vector store. The inner graph remains a standard HNSW graph — only the distance function changes during traversal.

### Search Flow

1. **Query preparation**: Rotate the query vector using the learned orthogonal rotation matrix. Cost: ~60 us for 768D (amortized over hundreds of distance evaluations per search).
2. **Binary traversal**: Traverse the HNSW graph using XOR + popcount binary distances with affine correction factors. Oversampling ratio of 6x compensates for coarser binary fidelity (vs 4x for SQ8). Cost: ~2 ns per candidate.
3. **Float32 re-ranking**: Collect `k * 6` coarse candidates, then compute exact f32 distances from the inner `NativeHnsw` vector store. Return the top-k with exact distances.

If the quantizer is not yet trained, search falls back transparently to standard f32 distances.

### Training

Training is **lazy**: vectors are buffered until `training_sample_size` (1000) are accumulated, then the quantizer trains automatically on the next insert. Until trained, all operations use standard f32 distances.

```rust
// Quantizer trains automatically after 1000 inserts
for (id, vec) in vectors {
    collection.upsert(id, &vec, None)?;
}

// Or force training early with fewer vectors
rabitq_hnsw.force_train_quantizer()?;
```

### Interior Mutability

`RaBitQPrecisionHnsw` uses interior mutability for thread-safe concurrent access:

| Field | Type | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| `rabitq_index` | `RwLock<Option<Arc<RaBitQIndex>>>` | Trained quantizer (write-locked once during training, then read-only) |
| `rabitq_store` | `RwLock<Option<RaBitQVectorStore>>` | Binary-encoded vector storage |
| `training_buffer` | `Mutex<Vec<Vec<f32>>>` | Pre-training vector accumulator |

**Ordering invariant**: The store must be visible before the index. Search checks `rabitq_index` first — a `Some(index)` with `None` store would silently skip RaBitQ encoding.

### Performance

| Metric | Standard (f32) | RaBitQ | Ratio |
|--------|---------------|--------|-------|
| Memory bandwidth per candidate | 1x | 1/32x | **32x reduction** |
| Distance computation | ~10 ns (f32 SIMD) | ~2 ns (XOR + popcount) | **5x faster** |
| Query preparation | 0 | ~60 us (768D) | One-time per query |
| Minimum index size | N/A | 5000 vectors | Below threshold: f32 fallback |

## Cosine: Pre-Normalized Dot-Product Kernel

For the cosine metric, production engines are constructed pre-normalized
(`CachedSimdDistance::new_prenormalized`): vectors are normalized in place at
insert (under the vectors write lock) and at legacy-file load, and queries are
normalized once per search in `prepare_query`. Every distance in the hot loop
is then a single dot-product chain (`1 - dot`) instead of the full cosine
formula's three accumulator chains plus a sqrt and a divide.

Two contracts follow from the unit-norm invariant:

- **Recovery pass 3** normalizes the WAL storage copy with the same SIMD
  kernel before its byte comparison, so surviving vectors still compare
  bit-identical.
- **`file_load`** re-establishes the invariant for pre-invariant files behind
  an epsilon gate that leaves already-normalized files bitwise untouched, so
  save/load roundtrips stay bit-identical.

(An experimental PDX block-columnar layout used to be documented here; it was
never wired into any search path and doubled vector memory when the optimize
endpoint ran, so it was removed in the Tier-S perf wave — see git history if
the design is revisited.)

## Software Pipelining

VelesDB implements **software-pipelined HNSW search** that overlaps prefetch of the next candidate's neighbor vectors with distance computation of the current batch, hiding main-memory latency behind useful ALU work.

### Activation Conditions

The pipelined path activates when **both** conditions are met:

1. **`should_prefetch()` returns `true`**: the vector spans at least 2 cache lines (dimension >= 32 for 4-byte f32, i.e., >= 128 bytes).
2. **`vectors.len() >= 10_000`**: the dataset exceeds ~30 MB at 768-dim (3 KB/vec), ensuring data is not fully L3-resident. Below this threshold, vectors are likely cache-hot and prefetch overhead exceeds the benefit.

```rust
// Activation logic in search_layer:
let use_prefetch = should_prefetch(vectors.dimension());
let use_pipeline = use_prefetch && vectors.len() >= 10_000;
```

### Pipeline Strategy

The pipeline uses **peek-based speculative prefetch** (not pop-ahead), which preserves identical heap exploration order and recall:

```
1. Pop current candidate from min-heap
2. Gather current candidate's unvisited neighbors
3. Peek (without popping) at the NEXT candidate in the min-heap
4. Prefetch next candidate's neighbor vectors into CPU cache
5. Compute distances for current batch (DRAM latency hidden by step 4)
6. Process results into search state
7. Repeat
```

Because the next candidate is only peeked — never consumed before the current batch is fully processed — the heap exploration order is identical to the non-pipelined loop.

### Correctness Guarantee

The pipelined path produces **identical results** to the non-pipelined path. Only memory access order differs. If the current batch adds a closer candidate that displaces the peeked one, the speculative prefetch is wasted but harmless (only occupies a few cache lines).

### Key Source Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `native/graph/search_pipeline.rs` | Pipelined search loop implementation |
| `native/graph/search.rs` | `should_prefetch()` threshold, activation logic |

## AutoTune Search

`SearchQuality::AutoTune` computes optimal `ef_search` range from collection statistics, then delegates to the adaptive two-phase search algorithm. This is the recommended quality setting for applications that want good recall without manual ef tuning.

### How It Works

1. **`auto_ef_range(count, dimension, k)`** computes `(min_ef, max_ef)`:
   - **Base ef** scales in discrete tiers by collection size:
     - 0--1K vectors: `k * 2`
     - 1K--10K vectors: `k * 4`
     - 10K--100K vectors: `k * 8`
     - 100K+ vectors: `k * 12`
   - **Dimension factor**: high-dimensional spaces (>512) apply a 1.5x multiplier for sparser neighborhoods.
   - **`min_ef`** is clamped to at least `k` (never fewer candidates than requested results).
   - **`max_ef`** is set to `4 * min_ef`, giving the adaptive second phase ample headroom for hard queries.

2. **Adaptive two-phase search**: starts with `min_ef`, escalates to `max_ef` if the query is hard (same algorithm as `SearchQuality::Adaptive`).

### Usage

**Rust**:

```rust
use velesdb_core::SearchQuality;

let results = index.search_with_quality(&query, 10, SearchQuality::AutoTune);
```

**Python**:

```python
results = collection.search_with_quality(
    vector=query,
    quality="autotune",
    top_k=10,
)
```

**REST API**:

```json
POST /collections/documents/search
{
  "vector": [0.1, 0.2, ...],
  "top_k": 10,
  "mode": "autotune"
}
```

### When to Use AutoTune

| Scenario | Recommended Quality |
|----------|-------------------|
| Fixed workload, known recall target | `Balanced` or `Accurate` with explicit `ef_search` |
| Variable collection sizes, no tuning budget | **`AutoTune`** |
| Latency-critical, recall > 90% acceptable | `Fast` |
| Must guarantee 100% recall | `Perfect` |

## Benchmarks

Run the HNSW benchmark:

```bash
cargo bench -p velesdb-core --bench hnsw_benchmark --features "persistence,internal-bench" -- --noplot
```

## Future Optimizations

- **int8 graph traversal**: Use quantized vectors for graph exploration
- **PCA dimension reduction**: Reduce dimensions during traversal
- **GPU acceleration**: CUDA/Vulkan compute shaders for batch operations
