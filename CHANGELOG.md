# Changelog

All notable changes to VelesDB will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- **`.vectors` now has a v2 format: the payload starts page-aligned at byte
  4096 instead of byte 16.** The header fields are unchanged and at the same
  offsets; only the payload moved, into a zero-filled reserved gap.

  The gap is not padding for its own sake. The graph's f32 arena hands out
  `&[f32]` built with `slice::from_raw_parts`, whose contract requires proper
  alignment, so a payload starting at byte 16 could never be mapped as one.
  Moving it is what lets the file *be* the arena rather than be copied into one.

  **Compatibility runs one way.** A current binary reads v1 and v2; a binary
  from before this change rejects a v2 file with `Unsupported version: 2`.
  Downgrading past this release therefore requires re-persisting the index —
  a plain `git checkout` of an older build will not open a database written by
  this one. `.vectors` had no version-compat mechanism at all before this, so
  the v1 read path was written here rather than inherited.

### Added

- **The durable `.vectors` file is now mapped as the graph's arena** instead of
  being deserialized into a second copy of the same bytes, on little-endian
  targets, for v2 files holding at least `MIN_ARENA_CAPACITY` vectors. Anything
  outside those conditions keeps the copy path: a mapped arena is an
  optimisation, never a requirement, so a filesystem that refuses the mapping
  costs the optimisation and nothing else.

  Adoption is observation-only by construction — below the capacity floor an
  arena would be sized up and the file grown, and **opening a collection must
  never write to it**, because the memory crate's migration resume proves a
  source store unchanged by hashing these files. A graph that adopted the
  durable file carries no `ArenaHome` at all, so the drop that deletes a
  disposable arena is unreachable rather than merely disabled.

- **`cargo-semver-checks` gates `velesdb-core` and `velesdb-memory`.** Each
  crate's public API is diffed against its last published release, and a
  breaking change without the major bump SemVer requires fails the build. Core
  runs with `--release-type minor`: `develop` carries the published version
  between releases, which the tool reads as a patch update, arming lints that
  only a release commit could satisfy.

- **A deferred removal promised for a future major can no longer be skipped by
  that major.** `scripts/check-deferred-removals.py` carries each promise with
  every site that must be gone, and fails the release commit that raises the
  major while a site survives. Written after `v6.0.0` shipped past exactly such
  a promise, two days after it was recorded in a doc comment nothing reads.

- **Issue bodies and comments are checked for assistant attribution.** The
  existing guard covered commits, pull request titles and bodies, and tracked
  content; those two surfaces arrive on events no `pull_request` workflow sees.

- **Two persistence instruments**, `persistence_save_scale` and
  `persistence_load_scale`, measuring the two halves of the round trip. The
  load one carries a control arm because a mapped load does not read the
  vectors — it maps them, and the pages fault in on first touch, so timing the
  load call alone reports the cost as gone when it has only moved.

### Deprecated

- **`[storage]` `data_dir`, `mmap_cache_mb` and `vector_alignment` — parsed
  and validated, never applied.** Issue #2087's per-knob audit found these
  three have no engine counterpart to wire them to at all (`data_dir` also
  conflicts irreducibly with the path passed to `Database::open`), unlike
  `storage_mode` and the rest of `[hnsw]`/`[search]`, which are still
  pending a wiring decision. They now get the same warn-not-reject
  deprecation cycle `[wal_batch]` (#2078) is already running — though
  `[wal_batch]` has no validation at all, while `mmap_cache_mb` keeps its
  pre-existing hard range check (left as is; loosening it is a separate
  change). `VelesConfig::validate` logs a warning naming exactly which of
  the three is set away from its default, and removal targets the next
  major (tracked by `scripts/check-deferred-removals.py`). No behavior
  changes — a config file setting them today keeps loading exactly as
  before.

### Performance

- **The vectors dump writes each vector's bytes in one call rather than one per
  `f32`** — 15.4 million calls at 20 000 nodes by 768 dimensions, each paying
  `BufWriter` bookkeeping to move four bytes. Measured on
  `persistence_save_scale` at 5 000 nodes by 3072d: **~34 % off the whole
  `save()`**, and ~2.1x on the dump alone once the graph-and-sidecar constant
  is subtracted.

- **Loading no longer copies the vector payload** when the file is adopted as
  the arena. The saving is real but its size depends on the query pattern, and
  `persistence_load_scale`'s module docs carry the measurement with the two
  caveats that bound it rather than a single flattering ratio.

### Fixed

- **`GeoPoint` coordinates were validated on insert but not on update.**
  `update_by_pk`, `update_multi_by_pk` and `batch_update` could each write a
  latitude or longitude outside `[-90, 90]` / `[-180, 180]`, which then fed
  `GEO_DISTANCE`/`GEO_BBOX` filtering and the Haversine formula itself. The
  range check now lives in the write primitive every validated write funnels
  through, so a future path cannot forget it the way the third one already had.

- **The `bytemuck` feature was removed from `velesdb-core`'s public surface**
  by the change that made the dependency mandatory, since Cargo derives a
  feature from `optional = true`. Any downstream manifest naming it — directly
  or through `gpu` — stopped resolving. Restored as a real feature enabling
  `bytemuck/derive`, which is what the 6.0.0 manifest gave, rather than a stub
  that keeps the name valid and fails at compile time instead of at resolution.
  Caught before release; no published version shipped without it.

- **`velesdb-node`'s tests could not link on macOS**, which blocked every local
  commit through the pre-commit hook whatever it touched. `napi_build::setup()`
  emits `rustc-cdylib-link-arg`, which reaches the cdylib and nothing else,
  while a test binary resolves its own Node-API symbols — supplied by the Node
  executable at load time, never by a library. CI never saw it: the Node
  binding job is path-filtered.

- **30 broken rustdoc intra-doc links in `velesdb-core`, and the two lints that
  let them accumulate.** Six were unresolved — all in a module's `//!` header,
  which rustdoc merges into the `mod` declaration that pulls it in, so once
  that declaration also carries `///` docs the paths resolve in the *parent's*
  scope (the same trap as the 49 links fixed in `velesdb-memory`). Twenty-four
  pointed at `pub(crate)`, `pub(super)` or private items a reader of the
  published docs cannot reach; those stop being links and become plain code
  spans rather than promising a page that would 404. No claim changed — only
  link syntax and the line wrapping that demoting a link disturbs, which
  `rustfmt` cannot re-flow (`wrap_comments` is nightly-only).

  `rustdoc::broken_intra_doc_links` and `rustdoc::private_intra_doc_links` are
  warn-by-default, which is why 30 here and 49 there went unnoticed. Both
  published crates now `#![deny]` them at the crate root, so a plain
  `cargo doc` fails for a contributor and on docs.rs — not only in the CI step
  that exports `RUSTDOCFLAGS`. A matching Lint step for `velesdb-core` keeps
  the docs actually built, since an attribute cannot fire if nobody builds
  them. `[workspace.lints.rustdoc]` remains future work: 17 such links survive
  in the crates that are not published to crates.io (`velesdb-wasm` 8,
  `tauri-plugin-velesdb` 4, `velesdb-server` 3, `velesdb-migrate` 2).
- **`npm advisories` no longer reads a registry outage as a vulnerability.**
  `npm audit` exits 1 both when it finds an advisory and when it cannot reach
  the advisory endpoint, and the gate ran it directly, so the two were
  indistinguishable. On 2026-09-03 the npmjs.org bulk endpoint returned 503s
  and then hung until npm's own five-minute network timeout for roughly eight
  hours; the job went red three times on `develop` reporting a vulnerability
  that did not exist — the lockfiles had not changed, and the same content had
  been green at merge time hours earlier. `scripts/npm-audit-gate.py` now reads
  the report (`metadata.vulnerabilities`, absent from npm's error payload)
  instead of the exit code, retries only the attempts that produced no report
  (four attempts, backoff 5s/10s/20s, each bounded at 120s), and still fails
  closed when none ever does — with exit 75 (`EX_TEMPFAIL`) and a message
  saying it is infrastructure, not a finding. An unaudited lockfile is not an
  audited one; what changes is that the job says which of the two happened.
  Registered in `scripts/guards.json` with a refusal vector whose accepted
  control is an npm double that exits 1 in both states.

- **`ProceduralMemory::reinforce`/`reinforce_with_strategy` could resurrect an
  expired-but-unswept procedure.** Every other write path on the struct
  (`relate`, `set_ttl`, `update_metadata`'s analog on `SemanticMemory`) rejects
  a TTL-expired id via `memory_helpers::ensure_live` before touching it, but
  `reinforce_with_strategy` fetched the point with a raw `collection.get`
  instead, so reinforcing an id whose TTL had elapsed but had not yet been
  swept by `auto_expire` silently mutated confidence, usage and success/failure
  counters on a point already invisible to `recall`, `list_all` and `relate`.
  It now shares `ensure_live` with the rest of the struct and returns
  `NotFound`, matching every sibling accessor.

## [6.0.0] - 2026-09-02

### Security

- **`browserslist` advisory in `examples/react-wasm-search` (GHSA-c83g-rgw3-j3cx,
  GHSA-73wf-gq98-2v4g).** Both were published upstream while PRs were in
  flight: the `npm advisories (examples/react-wasm-search)` gate passed at
  17:02 UTC and failed at 17:38 on an unchanged lockfile, and reproduces on
  `develop` itself. `browserslist` 4.28.2 → 4.28.8 via `npm audit fix
  --package-lock-only`, which also carries its data tables
  (`caniuse-lite`, `electron-to-chromium`, `node-releases`,
  `baseline-browser-mapping`) forward. All dev-only, all within the same
  major — no `--force`, so `package.json` constraints are untouched. The
  three other lockfiles in the repo audit clean.

### Added

- **A guard that no adapter forwards its trait partially (#1967).**
  `scripts/check-trait-forwarding.py` reads every adapter under `crates/*/src`
  that exists only to delegate — the generic wrapper
  `impl<T: Trait + ?Sized> Trait for Box<T> | Arc<T> | Rc<T>`, and the erased
  alias `impl Trait for DynTrait` where `type DynTrait = Box<dyn Trait>` —
  and demands the impl define every method the trait declares. An ordinary
  `impl Trait for Backend` is deliberately exempt: a concrete backend is
  entitled to the trait's default, which is what a default is for.

  The bug it prevents is narrow, which is exactly why it needs a machine.
  rustc already refuses an `impl` that omits a *required* method, so a partial
  forwarding can only ever drop a method that has a **default body** — and
  then it compiles: `Arc<Concrete>` silently runs the trait's default instead
  of `Concrete`'s override. `Extractor::extract_graph` is the shape that
  already cost the repo a bug (the #1690–#1692 gap family): forward only
  `extract`, and every `Arc`-held backend loses the relations and attributes
  it actually produced. `velesdb-memory`'s doctrine in `src/lib.rs` states the
  rule — "an adapter forwards the **whole** trait" — and until now only review
  enforced it.

  Five forwardings are checked today — four generic wrappers (`Reranker`,
  `Embedder`, `Extractor`, `TokenEstimator`) and one erased alias
  (`DynReranker`, which is what the Node binding wraps a JS callback in);
  all five are whole. The alias shape carries no generic parameter, so a
  wrapper-only pattern never sees it, and it is precisely where a dropped
  method would be lost for every JS caller while the Rust tests, which use the
  concrete type, stayed green.

  Supertrait methods are deliberately not demanded: the storage facets of
  #1959 are separate traits, and the doctrine's unit is the facet. A trait
  defined outside the scanned tree is reported `SKIPPED` rather than passed,
  so a miss the guard cannot see never reads as a clean run.

  Wired into `ci.yml`'s `lint` job with its self-test, registered in
  `scripts/guards.json` with three executable refusal vectors and its blind
  spot (presence, not delegation: a forwarded method whose body reimplements
  the default rather than calling `(**self)` still satisfies the guard).

- **`[hnsw]` is applied by the engine (#2087).** `m` and `ef_construction`
  from the configuration file now reach the HNSW index of every collection the
  `Database` creates — vector collections and graph collections with node
  embeddings alike. Before this, they were parsed and *validated* and read by
  nothing: a config could be rejected for an out-of-range value on a knob that
  did nothing, which signals harder than silence that the knob works.

  The precedence chain is explicit and per-field:

  ```text
  per-collection creation argument  >  [hnsw] section  >  HnswParams::auto(dimension)
  ```

  A collection created with an explicit `m` and no `ef_construction` still
  takes `ef_construction` from the section. `create_vector_collection_with_params`
  bypasses the section entirely — a fully specified `HnswParams` is already an
  answer, and merging a file the caller never mentioned into it would be
  surprising. Resolution lives in `Database`, the only component that owns a
  `VelesConfig`, so `Collection` and the index stay config-free.

  These are **creation-time** values: they are persisted into the collection's
  own config and fix its graph topology, so editing the section later affects
  new collections only. Re-tuning an existing collection is an index rebuild
  (`auto_reindex`), not a config reload.

  **No behaviour changes without an explicit section.** A default `[hnsw]`
  resolves to exactly `HnswParams::auto(dimension)`, and the creation paths
  persist the same `pq_rescore_oversampling = Some(4)` they did before, so a
  collection created without config is byte-for-byte what the pre-wiring code
  produced. A test asserts this directly.

  `hnsw.max_layers` stays inert and `[search]`, `[storage]`, `[quantization]`
  stay unwired; `VelesConfig::validate` still warns for them, narrowed to name
  the single inert field rather than the whole `[hnsw]` section — a warning
  that fires on knobs that now work would train readers to ignore it.

  New public API: `HnswParams::from_config`,
  `VectorCollection::create_with_hnsw_params`,
  `GraphCollection::create_with_hnsw_params`.

### Changed

- **A project's working-context index is bounded at 1 000 sessions
  (`MAX_WORKING_SESSIONS_PER_PROJECT`).** The index is one fact per project,
  rewritten whole on every `save_working_context` — serialised, embedded,
  stored. It gained an entry per distinct session id and shed one only when
  that session's fact was forgotten, so a long-lived project paid
  O(sessions) per save, forever, and `write_working_index` never checked the
  1 MiB fact cap (that check guards the working-context *content*, not the
  index). Past the cap the oldest-saved entries now leave the listing; their
  facts stay on disk and `load_working_context` still finds them by exact
  `project` + `session` — the semantic a torn index already had. The session
  being saved is pinned and can never be the one evicted, even in a
  same-second flood of other sessions. Found by the lock/resilience/memory
  audit of `velesdb-memory`; the audit's other findings were negative (no
  `std::sync` locks, no nested holds, the global index lock never held across
  the embedder, every other collection already capped).

### Fixed

- **The Binary Size Gate could not fail.** `binary-size.yml` ran
  `python scripts/check_binary_size.py | tee binary-size-report.txt` under
  GitHub's default `bash -e {0}`, where a pipeline's exit status is the last
  command's. The step therefore took `tee`'s 0, and the job — a required check
  through `CI Success` — reported success no matter what the guard returned. It
  did exactly that on #2193: the guard printed `Binary size gate FAILED` for
  two binaries under a green check. The step now sets `pipefail` and exits on
  the guard's status, capturing it first so the report still reaches the run
  summary on the run where it matters.

  The registry entry had asserted the opposite: it called the over-ceiling half
  "not vector-testable" and said it was "exercised for real on every release".
  Both were wrong. The guard reads `st_size`, so a sparse fixture exceeds any
  ceiling for free — `scripts/tests/test_check_binary_size.py` now covers that
  half, the `<=` boundary, and a ceiling silently raised out from under what
  the project ships. And the half declared "exercised for real" was the only
  half the pipe made unreachable.

  `scripts/tests/test_ci_gate_reachability.py` closes the class rather than the
  instance: every strict guard is now checked for an invocation whose status a
  pipe discards, on the *logical* command rather than the source line — the
  `|` sat on a backslash continuation, which is why the existing disarm tokens
  (`--mode warn`, `|| true`, `continue-on-error`) never saw it. No other strict
  guard in the repository is piped away.

- **Binary size ceilings re-baselined onto what the project actually ships.**
  With the gate able to refuse, the old ceilings (12 / 10 / 9 MiB) turned out
  never to have been cleared. Measured on one machine, same toolchain,
  `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`: v5.2.0 — already published — builds `velesdb-server`
  to 13.68 MiB and `velesdb` to 10.99 MiB, against 13.68 and 11.04 for 6.0.0.
  6.0.0 adds 6320 bytes to the server binary, 0.04 %. This is a re-baseline onto
  measured reality, not headroom granted to a regression; the new ceilings
  (14.25 / 11.5 / 9 MiB) carry ~3 %, enough for a toolchain bump and tight
  enough that a new multi-MB dependency still fails.

- **`save_working_context` refuses an empty `project` or `session`.** Both
  are the id the state is filed under and listed by; an empty one hashed,
  encoded and listed fine — as `""` — and was unrecoverable by anyone who did
  not think to ask for the empty string. Now
  `MemoryError::EmptyWorkingContextKey { key }` names which one, before
  anything is written. Same audit, same file as the index bound above.
- **`fused_recall_benchmark` could not run past its first parameter point.**
  It hung every fact off one entity hub and asserted the walk reached all of
  them — the liveness gate that proves a search regression cannot benchmark a
  no-op. Issue #1743 then capped a single node's expansion at
  `MAX_WHY_NODE_DEGREE` (64) and the whole walk at `MAX_WHY_NODES` (500), so
  at degree 200 the walk reached 66 nodes (64 + seed + hub), the assertion
  panicked, and four of the bench's five measurements were never taken. The
  empirical check for #1742's O(edges + nodes) traversal fix had been dead
  since that cap landed; nothing noticed because CI's `Internal Bench
  Compiles` only `cargo check`s `velesdb-core`'s benches.

  The fixture is now a forest of hubs, each mentioning at most
  `MAX_WHY_NODE_DEGREE` facts, so the reach the walk covers still grows into
  the hundreds while every node stays inside the policy it actually runs
  under. The sweep covers both regimes the caps create: three points under
  `MAX_WHY_NODES` where the walk must reach every fact exactly, and one past
  it where it must truncate at precisely the ceiling and the cost must
  plateau. Relaxing the assertion to `min(degree, 64)` was rejected — past
  64 the graph contribution is constant, and a bench that runs but no longer
  stresses what it was built to stress is a dead guard that looks alive.
  CI's `Internal Bench Compiles` job now also type-checks this crate's four
  benches (`cargo check -p velesdb-memory --benches`), so the compile half
  of a future death is caught on every PR; whether to *run* them per PR
  stays a policy decision and is not taken here.

- **`VectorCollection::create_with_hnsw` documented a false equivalence.** It
  claimed that passing `None` for both arguments was "equivalent to
  `VectorCollection::create`". It is not: it persists
  `pq_rescore_oversampling = None` ("no explicit override", which migrations
  read differently) where `create` persists the engine default `Some(4)`. The
  rustdoc now states the difference and points at
  `create_with_hnsw_params` for a params override that keeps the `create`
  default. Behaviour is unchanged.

### Documentation

- **The `VELESDB_*` environment-variable defect was found here (#2185).**
  Re-verifying the table end to end while wiring `[hnsw]` — which #2087's
  validation bar requires — showed that no documented engine variable reached
  its field: `VELESDB_HNSW_M`, `VELESDB_HNSW_EF_CONSTRUCTION` and
  `VELESDB_LIMITS_MAX_COLLECTIONS` all loaded as their defaults, the last one
  despite an explicit rustdoc promise that it works. The fix is a behaviour
  change — currently-inert variables start taking effect — so it is tracked and
  shipped separately as #2185 rather than folded into this wiring.
### Fixed

- **No `VELESDB_*` environment variable reached its config field (#2185).** The
  figment provider was built `Env::prefixed("VELESDB_").split("_").lowercase(false)`,
  which carried two independent defects, either fatal on its own:

  - `lowercase(false)` left the key uppercase, so deserialization looked for a
    field literally named `HNSW` rather than `hnsw`. This is what broke even the
    single-token `VELESDB_HNSW_M`.
  - `split("_")` treated **every** underscore as a nesting separator, so
    `VELESDB_HNSW_EF_CONSTRUCTION` addressed `hnsw.ef.construction`. No field
    with an underscore in its name was reachable — which is most of them
    (`max_collections`, `ef_construction`, `query_timeout_ms`, `max_payload_size`).

  Verified against `develop` before the fix: `VELESDB_HNSW_M`,
  `VELESDB_HNSW_EF_CONSTRUCTION` and `VELESDB_LIMITS_MAX_COLLECTIONS` all loaded
  as their defaults — the last one despite an explicit rustdoc promise on
  `VelesConfig::load_from_path_engine_only` that it overrides the file.

  The provider now splits at the **section boundary only**: the first underscore
  following a known top-level table. Everything after it is the field name, kept
  verbatim. A name whose first token is not a section passes through unsplit, so
  `VELESDB_CONFIG`, `VELESDB_NO_UPDATE_CHECK` and the server's own
  `VELESDB_HOST` / `VELESDB_PORT` keep matching nothing here, exactly as before.
  Both `load_from_path` and `load_from_path_engine_only` share one provider, so
  the two cannot drift.

  **This is a behaviour change, not only a fix.** Variables that were inert now
  take effect. An operator carrying a stale `VELESDB_LIMITS_MAX_COLLECTIONS=5`
  in their environment will start getting `GuardRail` refusals on collection
  creation after upgrading — the value they set, finally applied. Check the
  environment of any deployment that exports `VELESDB_*` before upgrading.

  A variable is exactly equivalent to its TOML key, so a **reserved** key stays
  reserved when set this way: `VELESDB_SEARCH_MAX_RESULTS` is parsed, validated
  and applied by nothing, same as `[search] max_results`.

### Documentation

- **`docs/guides/CONFIGURATION.md`'s env-var table conflated two config
  systems.** `VELESDB_HOST`, `VELESDB_PORT`, `VELESDB_DATA_DIR`,
  `VELESDB_RATE_LIMIT`, `VELESDB_API_KEYS` and `VELESDB_TLS_*` are
  `velesdb-server`'s own transport variables and were listed as though they
  addressed `VelesConfig` sections; they never will, since `[server]`/`[auth]`/
  `[tls]` are filtered out by `load_from_path_engine_only`. They now have their
  own table. `VELESDB_STORAGE_MODE` was listed as `storage.storage_mode`, which
  no regular mapping produces — corrected to `VELESDB_STORAGE_STORAGE_MODE`.

### Added

- **The `clippy::significant_drop_tightening` backlog is frozen where it stands
  (#2110).** `Cargo.toml` denies `significant_drop_in_scrutinee` — a guard
  living to the end of a `match`/`if let`/`for` scrutinee is how the
  CircuitBreaker ABBA deadlock (#2109) reached production — and allows its
  sibling, which flags a guard held past its last use. The sibling was left off
  pending a drain. The drain never started, and nothing measured it.

  **The tracked figure was wrong.** #2110 records "192 sites"; re-measured
  against `develop` @ `64a21b65` the real count was **326 diagnostics across 75
  files** for `velesdb-core` + `velesdb-server` with `--all-targets` (135 for
  `velesdb-core --lib` alone). 192 is reproducible only as a `grep -c` over
  clippy's human-readable output, which counts note lines rather than findings.
  There are also **zero** `allow(clippy::significant_drop_tightening)`
  attributes in the tree, so "drain the 192 sites" does not describe removing
  192 allows down to zero — promoting the lint will *add* allows for the sites
  that hold a guard deliberately.

  `scripts/check-drop-tightening.py` + `scripts/drop-tightening-baseline.txt`
  freeze the per-file counts, mirroring `check-file-budgets.py`: a new file, a
  grown count, a stale entry above the true count, and a drained file still
  listed all fail. The lint is `allow`ed workspace-wide, so it is re-enabled
  with `--force-warn`, which overrides both the `[workspace.lints]` entry and
  CI's `-D warnings` — the findings come back as warnings and the run still
  exits 0.

  The `Drop-Tightening Backlog Frozen` job is deliberately its own, not a step
  folded into `lint`: `--force-warn` changes the rustc argument fingerprint, so
  folding it in would either rebuild inside `lint` anyway or force `lint`'s
  clippy invocation through a JSON-parsing wrapper — and a wrapper that can
  stop failing silently is worse than a second job. As a separate job it cannot
  weaken the primary lint gate.

  Verified end to end rather than by construction: injecting one
  guard-held-too-long site into `database/collection_ops.rs` makes the gate fail
  with `grew from 8 to 10`, and removing it restores the pass. 19 unit tests
  drive `--from-json` with synthetic diagnostics (so they need no toolchain) and
  two `must_refuse` vectors in `scripts/guards.json` run the same refusals
  through the shared harness.

  Scope is `velesdb-core` + `velesdb-server` — the crates that build without
  GTK, so the baseline is one anybody can regenerate and verify. That is
  recorded as the guard's registered blind spot rather than papered over:
  widening it needs a measured baseline from a machine that can build the
  remaining crates, never an estimate.

- **Squared-L2 and dot-product masked tails are covered (#2106 item 14).**
  Both kernels handle their remainder in two stages — a 16-wide bridge loop,
  then one masked chunk — and no named test reached either at the 4-accumulator
  or 8-accumulator width. Checked rather than assumed:
  `distance_engine_tests.rs` uses 128/256/384/512/768/1024/1536/3072, every one
  at or above 512 an exact multiple of its kernel's stride;
  `simd_native_dispatch_tests.rs` reaches the 2-acc mask at 100/127/255 and
  nothing wider; and `warmup_tests.rs` only appears to reach 767, which is a
  value inside its generator, not the vector length (768, a multiple of 64).

  `l2_dot_tail_tests.rs` names a dimension for every stage: 513 for a mask with
  no bridge, 533 for one bridge pass then a 5-wide mask, 544 for two bridge
  passes with the mask skipped, 575 for the widest 4-acc remainder, and
  1025/1041/1279 for the same three shapes at 8-acc — with the exact multiples
  kept alongside as controls so a failure localizes to the main loop or the
  tail. The reference is accumulated in `f64` rather than as a second f32 loop,
  so a disagreement says which side is wrong, and the bound is relative because
  these are sums of up to 2048 terms.

  It also ties `batch_dot_product_native` to `dot_product_native` at every one
  of those dimensions. The batch entry point resolves the kernel once from the
  dimension and applies it per candidate — a second dispatch site with the same
  thresholds and its own chance to pick the wrong arm, previously bound to the
  single-vector path by nothing.

  Every guarantee was mutation-checked. Dropping one element from the masked
  chunk of each of the six kernels fails at the expected dimension (L2 4-acc at
  513, L2 8-acc at 1025, dot 2-acc at 1, dot 4-acc at 513, dot 8-acc at 1025),
  and double-counting the L2 4-acc bridge body fails at 533 — which is what
  proves the bridge is reached at all, the stage the audit recorded as
  unreachable. (#2106)

- **Graph metrics reach `/metrics`.** `GraphMetrics` was updated on every edge
  write and every traversal and read by nothing: across the whole workspace,
  `to_prometheus` had exactly two callers and both were its own unit tests. The
  server's `/metrics` handler assembled an entirely different set of types
  (`operational_metrics`, `global_guardrails_metrics`, `traversal_metrics`, the
  query-duration histogram), so nothing the graph recorded ever left the
  process. A stale comment on `match_metrics.rs` asserting these were
  "consumed by velesdb-server" is what let the surface look wired.

  Exporting it was not a one-line call from the handler. A `GraphMetrics`
  lives on an edge store, so there is one per collection, while the metric
  names are shared: concatenating a per-collection block would have repeated
  `# HELP`/`# TYPE` for a single family and published several samples under an
  identical, empty label set — a scraper rejects the duplicated declaration
  and keeps only the last of the duplicated series, so the exposition would be
  invalid and silently lossy at once. The unlabelled `to_prometheus(&self)` is
  therefore replaced by a free function over `(collection, &GraphMetrics)`
  pairs that declares each family once and tags every sample with
  `collection="…"`. Collection names are `[A-Za-z0-9_-]`, so no label value can
  need escaping — asserted against `validate_collection_name` rather than
  trusted to a comment. `Database::graph_metrics_prometheus` sorts by name so a
  scrape diff reflects metric movement rather than `HashMap` order, and returns
  an empty string when no graph collection exists rather than advertising
  families with no samples. (#2091)

- **MATCH query metrics reach `/metrics`.** `MatchMetrics` was updated on
  every MATCH dispatch — throughput, success/failure counts, the latency
  histogram, result counts — and, like `GraphMetrics` before #2091, read by
  nothing but its own unit tests: `to_prometheus` had no caller in
  `velesdb-server`, despite the module's own comment claiming it did. Fixed
  the same way: the module's private `LazyLock` static is now
  `match_metrics::global_match_metrics()`, `Database::match_metrics_prometheus`
  exposes it, and the `/metrics` handler calls it. Unlike graph metrics this
  collector is process-wide rather than per-collection — MATCH queries are
  not yet attributed to the collection they touch — so no label-collision
  handling was needed. `QueryTimer` and the `avg_*` accessors on the same
  struct still have no caller outside this module's tests; left alone rather
  than widened into this change. (#2106)

- **`StorageMode::SQ8` is a real search-path mode on Euclidean and Cosine.**
  Collections created with `storage='sq8'` now run the VSAG-style
  dual-precision HNSW backend: graph traversal compares int8 codes (1
  byte/dimension read instead of 4) and the final top-k is re-ranked with
  exact f32 distances (recall@10 >= 0.95 pinned on 10K vectors through the
  default configuration). The quantizer trains lazily after 1000 inserts or
  via the new `TRAIN QUANTIZER ... WITH (type=sq8)`, persists to `sq8.idx`
  (lazy training persists on each full flush, parity with RaBitQ), and is
  re-installed on reopen before gap recovery. On metrics whose ordering
  int8 L2 cannot preserve (DotProduct/Hamming/Jaccard) the mode stays exact
  f32, and `TRAIN QUANTIZER type=sq8` is rejected up front. The f32 vectors
  stay in the index for re-ranking, but a quantized mode now holds them in a
  file-backed arena the kernel can reclaim: at 100 000 x 768-d that moves
  293.0 MiB out of anonymous RSS, cutting it **61%** (385.0 -> 150.4 MiB),
  while total RSS rises 11% and a cold re-rank costs ~8 ms. Measured, not
  projected — see
  [Measured resident set](docs/guides/QUANTIZATION.md#measured-resident-set).
  Getting the codes themselves out of the resident set remains #2112
  Phase B. (#2112)

### Removed

- **`WalBatcher` is retired rather than wired (#2078).** 441 lines: the module
  and its 245-line test file, which was the only thing that ever called it.

  The issue asked for a decision between wiring the group-commit front and
  removing it. The audit that settled it turned up an argument the issue did
  not have: **`WalBatcher` was never a group-commit protocol.** `submit`
  (`wal_batcher.rs:124-140`) took its mutex only long enough to extend a
  `Vec<u8>` and bump a counter, then returned `Ok`. Only the submitter whose
  increment crossed `max_batch_size` flushed; every other one was told its
  write had succeeded while its bytes were still in memory. A real group commit
  makes the non-leaders *wait* for the leader's fsync. Wiring this was therefore
  never "connect the existing module" — it was "build the barrier it never had".

  Two further findings, each sufficient on its own. `commit_delay_us` — the
  section's central knob — is read by nothing, including the batcher: there is
  no thread, no condvar and no timer in the file, so the "max delay before
  flush" setting did nothing even inside the module it configured. And the
  amortization it was written to provide already ships:
  `LogPayloadStorage::store_batch`/`store_batch_deferred` and
  `MmapStorage::store_batch` each pay one barrier per call and are wired into
  `crud.rs`, `crud_bulk.rs` and `bulk_import.rs`.

  `docs/CORE_WIRING_DEBT.md:56-80` already recorded why wiring was blocked
  anyway — `LogPayloadStorage` resolves a record's file offset *inside*
  `write_store_record` at write time, so a deferred write cannot update the
  index at submit time — and why it would have bought nothing if it weren't:
  `Collection::payload_storage` is an `Arc<RwLock<..>>` whose outer `.write()`
  already serializes every writer.

  Nothing outside the module could reach it: `pub(crate)` since #1861, with no
  root re-export, and `MIGRATION_v5.0.0.md:56-63` already told users it had left
  the public API. It was never announced as a shipped feature in any release.

  **`WalBatchConfig` and the `[wal_batch]` table stay for now**, so existing
  TOML files keep loading, with the #2082 warning still firing when `enabled =
  true`. Removing them is a Rust API break — `VelesConfig` is constructed
  literally in the tree — and the `ENGINE_SECTIONS` whitelist entry must go in
  the same change, or `#[serde(default)]` would turn a surviving `[wal_batch]`
  table into a parse failure. That half is for the next major.

  `docs/guides/CONFIGURATION.md` is corrected in the same pass: its
  reserved-sections callout covered #2087's four sections but not this one, so
  the guide still listed `[wal_batch]` among the sections reaching "the running
  engine" with nothing to qualify it.

- **The unwired `score_fusion` module is retired rather than repaired (#2106
  items 6 and 7).** 1583 lines: the module, its 553-line test file, and the BDD
  characterization test that existed to document its defects.

  The items asked "fix or retire". Retire, and the reasons are checkable rather
  than aesthetic:

  - **It duplicates a feature that already ships and works.** The live fusion
    path is `crate::fusion::FusionStrategy` driven by VelesQL's `FusionClause`
    (`collection/search/text_fusion.rs`, exercised by
    `examples/python/fusion_strategies.py`). `score_fusion` is a second,
    parallel implementation of the same idea that shares no code with it — the
    module's own doc says it is "named `ScoreFusionMethod` to distinguish from
    the public `crate::fusion::FusionStrategy`".
  - **It was never shipped.** Marked EPIC-049 US-004, it has never appeared in
    this changelog under any release.
  - **The code says so itself.** `mod.rs` carried
    `#[allow(unused_imports)] // Re-exported for test access`.
  - **Its only Rust consumer was a test asserting it is broken.**
    `tests/bdd/fusion_weighted_bug.rs` locked in `Weighted == Average` and
    called it "a DEAD-PATH defect". Alongside it: the pseudo-RRF
    `1/(60+(1-s)*100)` divides by zero at `s = 1.6` and goes negative beyond,
    and `BoostCombination::Max` folds from an identity of 1.0 so an all-penalty
    boost set is ignored.

  Fixing three bugs in an unshipped duplicate would have added a maintained
  surface with no consumer. Git history keeps it for anyone who wants to revive
  the epic — including the per-hop decay fix landed for item 8, which went in
  before its home turned out to be dead.

  Three greps that look like consumers are name collisions, checked and
  discounted: `QueryPhase::ScoreFusion` is a tracing-span label,
  `text_fusion.rs`'s `score_fusion_strategy` is a private local function, and
  `example_relative_score_fusion` is a Python example of VelesQL RSF.


- **`DualPrecisionHnsw` and `DualPrecisionConfig`** (public in
  `index::hnsw::native`). The prototype was wired into no collection path,
  carried a latent cosine bug (raw query against normalized stored vectors
  in its rerank), and duplicated the `RaBitQ` traversal loop; its behavior
  pins moved onto the wired `Sq8PrecisionHnsw`. Also breaking for direct
  API users: `RaBitQPrecisionHnsw` is now a type alias over the generic
  backend and its `from_inner` dropped the unused distance-engine
  parameter.

### Changed

- **`mean_average_precision` now takes the corpus-wide relevant count, and MAP
  penalises what a search missed (#2106 item 12).** The signature was
  `&[Vec<bool>]` and the implementation divided by the number of relevant items
  *retrieved*, while the doc comment stated the textbook
  `AP = (1/R)·Sum P(k)·rel(k)` with `R` the total relevant in the corpus. The two
  disagree exactly where the metric earns its keep: retrieving **1 of 10**
  relevant documents, at rank 1, scored a flawless `AP = 1.0` for 10% recall. A
  ranking-quality metric blind to what it missed always flatters a system that
  returns one confident result and stops.

  The doc was not the thing to fix. `&[bool]` over retrieved positions simply
  cannot express `R`, so the signature moved instead: `&[(&[bool], usize)]`, each
  query pairing its relevance flags with the corpus total. A caller with no
  corpus-wide count reproduces the old behaviour by passing the retrieved count —
  explicitly, at the call site, rather than silently inside the metric. A
  `total_relevant` below the retrieved count is a caller error describing an
  impossible corpus; the denominator is raised to the retrieved count so a bad
  input cannot push `AP` above 1.0 and corrupt an average over many queries.

  The four pre-existing tests could not have caught this: every one used
  `total_relevant == retrieved`, the single case where both denominators agree.
  Two new tests encode the defect itself — 1-of-10 scoring 0.1 rather than 1.0,
  and AP falling monotonically as recall falls with the ranking held fixed — and
  both go red when the old normalisation is restored, while all four old tests
  stay green.


- **The `RaBitQ` traversal backend became a codec: one quantized-precision
  state machine, two codecs.** `RaBitQPrecisionHnsw`'s concurrent
  insert/train/install machinery and its graph traversal are now the
  codec-generic `QuantizedPrecisionHnsw<D, C>`/`TraversalCodec` pair, with
  RaBitQ a behavior-preserving alias over it (same defaults, same lock
  order, on-disk format unchanged) and SQ8 the second codec. The unwired
  `DualPrecisionHnsw` prototype and its duplicated traversal loop are
  deleted; its tests are ported onto the wired backend. (#2112)

- **`StorageMode::SQ8`/`Binary` stopped paying for quantization nobody
  reads.** Every upsert into these modes ran a parallel quantization pass
  and filled unbounded in-memory side-caches (one entry per vector) that no
  search path ever consumed — pure CPU plus unbounded RAM (~1 byte/dim/vector
  for SQ8) with zero effect on results, since the on-disk store and the HNSW
  index are full-precision f32 in these modes regardless. The dead caches
  and their fill/delete plumbing are removed; both modes are still accepted
  and persisted, and now honestly documented as behaving like `Full`
  (rustdoc + `docs/guides/QUANTIZATION.md`, whose "General production: SQ8"
  recommendation is corrected). Search results are byte-identical. Wiring
  the in-tree int8 dual-precision traversal engine into a real SQ8 backend
  is tracked in #2112. (#2112)

### Fixed

- **`EdgeStore`'s index maps kept an empty bucket alive for every node/label
  that ever had an edge, instead of evicting the key once its `Vec` emptied.**
  `purge_incoming_index`, `purge_outgoing_index` and `purge_label_indices` are
  the three helpers behind every edge-removal path (`remove_edge`,
  `remove_edge_outgoing_only`, `remove_edge_incoming_only`,
  `remove_node_edges`), and only one of the five maps they touch
  (`incoming_by_label`) ever removed its key when the bucket it pointed to
  went empty — `outgoing`, `incoming`, `by_label` and `outgoing_by_label` kept
  a stale key mapped to `vec![]` forever. Node ids are effectively never
  reused, so long-running ingest-then-remove workloads grew these maps
  without bound. `outgoing`/`incoming` are also the two fields without
  `#[serde(skip)]`, so their leaked keys were written to every snapshot and
  survived a reload — unlike the three label indices, which are rebuilt from
  `edges` on load and so only leaked within a process's lifetime.
  `csr_snapshot.rs`'s rebuild walks `outgoing_keys()` to size `node_to_index`,
  so the leak also inflated the cost of every CSR rebuild after add/remove
  churn. All four helpers now evict the key alongside the existing
  `incoming_by_label` behaviour they were supposed to match; no format or
  query-result change, verified by asserting the maps themselves return to
  empty rather than only checking `get_outgoing`/`get_edges_by_label`, which
  read the same whether a key is missing or mapped to an empty `Vec`.

- **`AnyCollection::upsert`'s graph arm pays one durability barrier instead of
  one per node (#2153).** The `Vector` and `Metadata` arms reach `crud.rs` and
  pay a single barrier for the whole batch; the `Graph` arm looped the
  single-node path, so under the default `DurabilityMode::Fsync` an N-node
  upsert cost **N** `flush` + `sync_all` pairs, N `maybe_auto_snapshot` checks,
  and two `label_index` acquisitions per node. Same class as the
  `store_batch_async` defect fixed in #2151, one layer up in the collection
  facade. Measured on this branch at the default `Fsync`: 500 nodes 86.6 ms ->
  4.5 ms (19.2x), 2 000 nodes 320.4 ms -> 16.0 ms (20.1x).

  Rather than add a second procedure beside the first, `store_node_payload` is
  now a batch of one: `PayloadStorage::store` and
  `LogPayloadStorage::store_batch` both funnel into `store_batch_inner`, so a
  one-element batch writes byte-identical WAL and pays exactly the barrier the
  single-node contract already promised. One procedure means the label index,
  the property indexes and the mirror invalidation cannot drift between the
  paths.

  Two behaviours are new rather than merely faster. Duplicate ids inside a batch
  resolve last-wins — load-bearing, because the un-index step reads each node's
  pre-batch payload and a repeated id would otherwise leave the first payload's
  label and property entries attached to a node that no longer carries them.
  And the whole batch is validated before anything is written, so a schema
  violation commits nothing; the per-node loop wrote each node as it went and
  left the prefix behind.

  `graph_api.rs` drops from 1021 to 943 lines and leaves
  `scripts/file-budgets-baseline.txt` entirely.

- **The no-AI-attribution rule is enforced on every surface it names, not just
  commits (CLAUDE.md #5).** The rule reads "not in code, comments, commits, PR
  titles or bodies, issues, or docs". Only commits were guarded, so four of
  those six surfaces were policed by whoever remembered to look.

  Two of them are now gates. `check-ai-attribution.py` grows `--text PATH
  --surface LABEL` for published prose — the PR **title** and **body** today,
  an issue or a comment the day a trigger can hand one over — and `--tree` for
  the repository's own tracked content, which is the "code, comments, docs"
  half and had no guard at all.

  **The body is the surface the rule loses on by default.** Tooling appends a
  "Generated by …" footer to a description server-side at publish time, so a
  pull request arrives already violating the rule with every commit in it
  clean. Three pull requests in one session were published carrying it, and the
  pull request that added this guard arrived with it too and had to be stripped
  before it could pass its own gate.

  **`--tree` found a gap that a doc grep would have missed.** The trailer
  patterns are anchored at column 0, deliberately, so this guard can describe
  its own patterns without tripping. In *source*, attribution wears a comment
  marker — and `// Generated with Claude` sailed straight past an anchor that
  refused the identical line in a commit message. `--tree` strips a comment or
  blockquote leader before applying the rule; the commit-message path
  deliberately does not, because prose describing a trailer mid-sentence is not
  a trailer.

  Every mode calls the same `message_is_refused`. That is the design decision,
  not a convenience: #1699 records what a second pattern list costs — the two
  inline shell copies this guard replaced *both* spelled `claude|anthropic` and
  nothing else, so Codex, Copilot, Cursor and unlisted bots walked through.

  `--tree` needs one admission, for the same reason `ADMITTED_AUTOMATION`
  exists: five files must contain the patterns to define, test or document the
  rule, and a guard that refuses its own hook is one that gets switched off.
  They are admitted by **exact path**, never by directory — an exemption
  becomes a loophole the moment it covers a tree. `CHANGELOG.md` and
  `CLAUDE.md` are deliberately not admitted: both describe the rule today
  carrying no pattern, which is the proof that describing it does not require
  carrying it.

  Titles and bodies reach the guard through `env:` and then a **file**, never
  as a shell argument or a `${{ }}` interpolation inside `run:`. Published
  prose is attacker-controlled text and interpolating it into a workflow script
  is a command-injection vector.

  Twenty new tests. Three limits are registered in the guard's blind spot
  rather than left to be discovered: issue and PR **comments** are still
  uncovered, because no trigger delivers one; a footer added by *editing* a
  description after the run is not re-checked, because `ci.yml` skips an
  `edited` event that does not change the base — the #22 fix that stopped
  no-op edits cancelling real runs; and `--tree` has no executable refusal
  vector, because the shared harness materialises one by copying the tracked
  tree and a mode that then reads every file in that copy exhausts the runner.

- **`store_batch_async` pays one durability barrier instead of one per vector
  (#2078).** Despite its name, it looped over `VectorStorage::store`, and
  `MmapStorage::store` under `DurabilityMode::Fsync` issues its own `flush` +
  `sync_all` per call. A 2 000-vector batch therefore paid 2 000 fsyncs, every
  one of them while holding the storage write lock — so the function billed as
  the one "for large batches that would otherwise block the async executor"
  was the slowest way in the crate to write them, and stalled every concurrent
  writer for the duration.

  `VectorStorage::store_batch` already exists for exactly this, coalescing the
  WAL entries into one grouped write and deliberately leaving the barrier to
  the caller; the fix is to call it and then `flush` once. Measured on 2 000
  vectors × 128 dimensions at the default `Fsync`: **11–21× faster across three
  runs** (320–540 ms down to 22–28 ms).

  The durability guarantee on return is unchanged, because `flush` dispatches
  on the same mode the per-vector path consulted — and marginally stronger,
  since the mmap is flushed too, which the loop never did. Error behaviour
  improves as well: `store_batch` validates every dimension before writing
  anything, so a malformed entry now rejects the batch rather than leaving the
  prefix before it committed.

  The one pre-existing test asserted only that the returned count was 100 —
  something the broken loop satisfied just as well — and never read a vector
  back. Three tests now pin what that count was standing in for: every vector
  is retrievable, a bad dimension commits nothing, and the batch survives
  closing and reopening the directory without the caller flushing.

  The write lock is scoped to the store-and-flush rather than to the whole
  closure. The barrier is the last thing it is needed for, and every concurrent
  writer waits behind it; holding it across the return bought nothing. The
  tests read under the lock and assert after releasing it, for the same reason
  — an assertion panics, and unwinding while holding the guard is worth
  avoiding even in a test.

- **A non-finite fusion weight can no longer reorder a result set (#2095).**
  Every weight rule in `fusion/strategy.rs` was an ordering comparison —
  `w < 0.0` for weights, `k <= 0.0` for the rank-smoothing constant — and every
  ordering comparison against `NaN` is false. A `NaN` therefore satisfied all of
  them, `FusionStrategy::weighted`, `relative_score` and `weighted_rrf` each
  returned `Ok`, and the kernel then produced a `NaN` contribution for every
  document in that branch.

  The consequence is worse than a `NaN` score. `sort_descending` orders by a
  partial comparison, so the `NaN`-scored documents did not sink — measured on a
  two-branch fusion with one `NaN` weight, the result was
  `[(1, NaN), (2, NaN), (3, 0.0164)]`: the only document carrying a real score
  ranked **last**, behind two documents with no score at all. A caller reading
  the top-k got a confident, silently inverted answer.

  `validate_non_negative` now checks finiteness before range, and the two
  hand-rolled `k <= 0.0` guards are replaced by a shared
  `validate_smoothing_constant`, so the rule is stated once for both the
  constructor and `fuse` (which revalidates, because the enum variants are
  public and can be built as literals). The new `FusionError::NonFiniteWeight`
  joins a `#[non_exhaustive]` enum, so no downstream `match` breaks.

  Both guards are mutation-checked: deleting the weight-side finiteness test
  fails 5 of the 8 new tests, deleting the `k`-side one fails the other 2, and
  the pre-existing 56 fusion tests stay green either way.

- **REST fusion weights are validated instead of applied verbatim (#2095).**
  Three of the four arms that build a weighted `FusionStrategy` from an HTTP
  body did it with a struct literal, which accepts any `f32` that deserialized.
  The core constructors — the ones enforcing non-negative, finite, summing to
  1.0 — were never called, so `/collections/{name}/search/multi` and the
  `fusion` block of `/search`, `/search/ids` and `/search/hybrid` accepted
  weights such as `avg_w = -0.2, max_w = 0.9, hit_w = 0.3` and returned `200`
  with a ranking that honoured none of the contract the weights imply.

  All four arms now go through the validating constructors and report the core
  message verbatim as a `400`, so the server carries no second copy of the
  weight rules to drift from. `multi.rs` splits the decision into a pure
  `build_fusion_strategy(&req) -> Result<_, String>` and a thin shell that owns
  the metrics and the HTTP response, which is what makes the eight new cases
  testable without standing up an `AppState`.

  The rustdoc table above `pipeline::parse_fusion_strategy` is corrected in the
  same pass: it advertised the pre-#1545 weighted defaults `0.5 / 0.3 / 0.2` and
  went on advertising them after #2093 fixed the code to read
  `DEFAULT_WEIGHTED_AVG_WEIGHT` and its siblings (`0.6 / 0.3 / 0.1`).

  Not addressed here, and recorded rather than dropped: `velesdb-cli` and
  `tauri-plugin-velesdb` each carry a fifth and sixth hand-written copy of the
  same name-to-strategy mapping, and the CLI's copy still hardcodes the
  pre-#1545 `0.5 / 0.3 / 0.2`. Collapsing all six onto one core entry point is
  the single-sourcing work of #2095 section B.

- **A PR can no longer break `internal-bench` and merge green.** The feature is
  not bench-only: it gates seven sites of *production* source —
  `index/hnsw/index/search.rs`, `index/hnsw/native/distance.rs`,
  `index/hnsw/mod.rs`, `velesql/cache.rs` and `lib.rs` — and nothing on a pull
  request ever compiled it. The two workflows that do, `quality-deep.yml` and
  `bench-scalability.yml`, run weekly, so a cfg regression could merge on a
  Tuesday and surface the following Sunday with no obvious culprit SHA. That is
  the failure mode `memory-feature-matrix` was added to close for
  `velesdb-memory`; `internal-bench` had the same hole and no gate.

  Demonstrated rather than asserted: renaming `eval_count::record_eval`, which
  only the `internal-bench` call sites reach, leaves today's CI build green in
  0.18 s and fails the new job with `E0425: cannot find function record_eval`.

  `Internal Bench Compiles` runs `cargo check` over the library, benches and
  tests under `persistence,internal-bench`, and is read by the `ci-success`
  chain. Deliberately a compile and not a bench run — the cost this gate is
  allowed to have is a compile, the same bargain `memory-feature-matrix`
  strikes. `--benches` is load-bearing: the feature's `required-features`
  targets are bench targets, so a lib-only check would miss the code the
  feature exists for.

- **A non-finite vector component can no longer enter or query the database
  (#2106 items 4 and 16).** The dense ingest path validated dimension and
  nothing else, so a `NaN` or an infinity reached storage. Its sparse sibling
  has always refused non-finite values — this is the dense path catching up to a
  decision the codebase had already made.

  This is not garbage-in-garbage-out. NaN compares `false` against everything,
  so **one** stored NaN makes HNSW's ordering arbitrary for every subsequent
  query, including well-formed ones. Measuring what the kernels do with one
  turned up something the audit did not have: the divergence it recorded as an
  aarch64 concern is live on x86 too, and worse than a scalar/SIMD split.
  `jaccard_similarity_native(a, b)` returns a finite score when the NaN sits in
  `a` and `NaN` when the identical NaN sits in `b`, from dimension 8 upward —
  `_mm256_min_ps(va, vb)` yields `vb` whenever either operand is NaN, while the
  scalar path's `f32::min` yields whichever operand is *not*. Jaccard is
  symmetric by definition, so `J(a, b) != J(b, a)` was reachable from stored
  data on the default platform.

  The fix is at the boundary, not in the kernels: `validate_vector_is_finite`
  refuses the value on upsert and on search, so no kernel ever sees one.
  Branching on NaN inside the hot SIMD loops would tax every well-formed query
  to serve a malformed one. The read side needed one call — every typed wrapper
  (`VectorCollection`, `MetadataCollection`, `GraphCollection`) delegates to the
  same `Collection::search` — and it costs one `O(dim)` pass against a search
  that is `O(dim × candidates)`.

  `simd_native::nan_contract_tests` pins the measured kernel behaviour so the
  guard cannot later be deleted as unnecessary: those tests are the evidence of
  what returns the moment it goes. The aarch64 half of item 4 is left
  deliberately unmeasured rather than asserted from the intrinsic's
  documentation.

- **The AVX kernels no longer compute out-of-bounds pointers (#2106 item 9).**
  Eleven loops guarded themselves with `while p.add(N) <= end_ptr`, and that is
  undefined behaviour on the final evaluation — the one that ends the loop.
  `pointer::add` requires the *computed* pointer to stay inside the same
  allocated object, one past the end included; when fewer than `N` elements
  remain it does not, and never dereferencing the result does not save it.
  Miri reports it as an out-of-bounds pointer computation, reproduced here on
  the guard shape with the intrinsics stripped out:

  ```
  error: Undefined Behavior: in-bounds pointer arithmetic failed: attempting to
  offset pointer by 32 bytes, but got alloc271+0x40 which is only 16 bytes from
  the end of the allocation
     --> while p.add(8) <= end
  ```

  Every compiler in use today emits the obvious address comparison, which is
  why this never produced a wrong answer — but LLVM is entitled to assume an
  `inbounds` GEP is in bounds, and one feeding a comparison is precisely the
  shape a future optimisation may fold. The defect is that the code asks a
  question it has no right to ask.

  `simd_native::ptr_span::has_at_least` asks it of the *distance* between the
  two cursors instead, on integers, where the arithmetic is defined for every
  input; the index-form guards already in the tree (`i + 16 <= len`) are the
  same idea for the loops that carry indices rather than pointers. All eleven
  sites now use it — eight in `x86_avx512.rs`, three in
  `x86_avx2_similarity.rs` — and the file-level claim that "loop guards ensure
  pointer arithmetic stays within the original slice bounds", which was the
  false one, is replaced by a pointer to the guard that now makes it true.

  Equivalence with the old guard is pinned exhaustively rather than sampled:
  for every length 0..=80, every cursor position within it, and every lane
  width in use, the new guard returns what `p.add(count) <= end` would have
  returned, and the consuming loop runs exactly `len / count` times leaving
  `len % count` for the scalar tail. A cursor past the end — unreachable
  through the kernels' own loop structure — is pinned to fail closed rather
  than wrap to a span that would walk off the buffer. `ptr_span_tests.rs`
  carries no intrinsics on purpose, so unlike the kernels it can be run under
  Miri. (#2106)

- **A manual CI dispatch can no longer turn a green `CI Success` red.**
  `ci-success` asserts `result == 'success'` for every job it reads, and
  `python-integrations` admitted only `pull_request` and `push`. Under
  `workflow_dispatch` it came back `skipped`, never `success`, so the gate was
  unsatisfiable under that trigger however green everything else was — the one
  manual escape hatch this workflow documents for the #1465 "required check is
  absent" failure mode could only ever produce a red verdict. That is worse
  than the hole it plugs: an absent check blocks a merge, a red one *replaces
  a green check-run of the same name* on the head SHA. Seen on PR #2141, where
  a dispatch run overwrote the green `CI Success` an earlier `pull_request` run
  had already recorded for the same commit.

  The job now admits `workflow_dispatch` too, and the rule is pinned rather
  than left to review: `test_ci_gate_reachability.py` now asserts that every
  job the chain reads can run under every trigger the `on:` block declares.
  `sonarcloud` is out of scope by construction — it is in `needs` but
  deliberately absent from the chain, so it may skip freely. Both directions
  were mutation-checked: reverting the guard and, separately, narrowing `lint`
  to `pull_request` each turn the new suite red at the offending job and
  trigger.

- **Cosine search scores keep their sign, on every path.** `transform_score`
  on the HNSW graph path shared one match arm with Jaccard and clamped to
  `[0, 1]`, so a genuinely negative cosine came back as exactly `0.0` — while
  brute force, the exact rerank and `DistanceMetric::calculate` all returned
  the cosine itself. Which path runs is not something the caller chooses: it
  falls out of corpus size (≤ 100 points goes brute force), `SearchQuality`,
  and even `k` (the rerank stage needs `len() > k * 2`). The same index and
  query returned `-0.557` at `k=10` and `0.0` at `k=80`.

  The two ranges also met inside a single result list. `merge_delta`
  concatenates HNSW results with delta-buffer results scored through
  `calculate` and sorts them together, so a freshly written point at true
  cosine `-0.2` sorted *below* an indexed point at `-0.5` that had been
  clamped to zero; VelesQL's `Parallel` execution strategy merges a scan leg
  and an HNSW leg the same way. And because every dissimilar document
  clamped to the same `0.0`, the ordering among anti-correlated matches was
  not merely wrong — it was gone.

  The range now has one definition, `DistanceMetric::score_range`, with
  `clamp_score` applying it; the graph path and the GPU rerank derive from it
  instead of each carrying a table. Cosine is `[-1, 1]`, Jaccard keeps its
  true `[0, 1]` floor, and the unbounded metrics declare no range. The GPU
  path's local table needed a `_ =>` catch-all; `score_range` matches every
  variant, so a new metric now fails to compile rather than silently landing
  in the wildcard. Two tests that had written the old range down as a rule
  are corrected to state what is actually true of their fixtures.

  Restoring the sign exposed a heuristic the clamp had been hiding.
  `search_adaptive` decides whether to widen `ef` from the first/last score
  gap divided by `min(|first|, |last|)` — a baseline that assumes zero is the
  metric's floor. It is, for an unbounded distance. On a similarity over
  `[-1, 1]` zero sits mid-range, so a merely mediocre tail of `-0.01` against
  a `0.9` top reads as a spread of 91 and escalates a query that is not hard.
  Cosine never hit that only because every non-positive score clamped to
  exactly `0.0`, which made the baseline zero and the guard fail: phase 2 had
  never escalated on this metric at all. The baseline is now the tail's
  distance from `score_range`'s floor, which is unchanged for the unbounded
  metrics (whose floor is zero) and keeps easy cosine queries cheap while
  still escalating a genuinely heterogeneous neighbourhood. The rule moved
  into a pure `should_escalate` so it is testable rather than inlined
  arithmetic. (#2106)

- **`TRAIN QUANTIZER` no longer reports an empty corpus for a collection that
  has no payloads.** Training enumerated the collection through
  `Collection::all_ids`, which is the *payload* store's view and says so in its
  own doc: "Only returns IDs that have payload entries stored. Points inserted
  with `None` payload may not appear." A collection used for pure vector search
  carries no payloads at all, so that view was empty and every quantizer type —
  pq, opq, rabitq and sq8, which share the extraction — failed with
  `[VELES-029] Training failed: no vectors available for training` about a
  collection holding its full count. Measured on a 256-point collection:
  `all_ids` 0, `all_point_ids` 256, `point_count` 256. Training now uses
  `all_point_ids`, documented as the authoritative set because it unions vector
  and payload storage; the existing `is_empty` filter already drops the
  metadata-only points it additionally brings in. (#2095)

- **`Database.train_pq` (Python) accepts every collection name core does.**
  The binding rendered VelesQL as text —
  `format!("TRAIN QUANTIZER ON {collection_name} WITH (m={m}, k={k}")` — and
  parsed it back. Interpolating a name into a query string is what forced the
  method to carry its own identifier rule ("prevent VelesQL injection via
  string interpolation"), and that rule was a second definition of what a
  collection may be called. It drifted from `velesdb_core::validation` three
  ways: it rejected the interior hyphen core accepts and pins (`a-b`, with
  `docs-v2` as the doc example); it passed a leading digit the grammar's
  `regular_identifier` then refused, surfacing as "Failed to construct TRAIN
  query"; and it passed the empty string vacuously, rendering
  `TRAIN QUANTIZER ON  WITH (...)`. The binding now builds the statement AST
  directly through `Query::new_train`, as `velesdb-mobile` and
  `tauri-plugin-velesdb` already do. No identifier text is produced, so there
  is no charset rule to keep in step and all three cases dissolve together;
  a bad name now fails in the engine with the engine's own error. (#2095)

- **A sparse query whose score cancels to zero no longer returns the same
  document twice.** `linear_scan_dense` tracked "have I recorded this
  document?" by testing `scores[idx] == 0.0`, reading membership out of the
  accumulated value. A negative query weight — the "like A but not B" shape,
  where both sides carry a shared term at the same weight — drives the running
  score back to exactly zero, and the next term's posting then recorded the
  document a second time. The duplicate is not merely a repeated row: it takes
  a slot in the top-k heap, so a genuine result is evicted. On a three-document
  fixture the correct `[1, 0, 2]` came back as `[1, 0, 0]`. Membership is now
  an explicit `seen` array, which also restores parity with the hash-map
  accumulator the router picks for sparse ID spaces — the two are chosen on
  performance grounds and must be observationally identical. (#2106)

- **Latency histograms bucket on the bound they export.** Both millisecond
  histograms — graph operations and MATCH queries — placed an observation with
  `ms < bound` while exporting the counts under Prometheus `le` labels, and
  `le` is *less than or equal*. A request taking exactly 5 ms was counted in
  `le="0.01"` and left out of `le="0.005"`, so every dashboard percentile and
  every SLO burn-rate alert read a bucket that excluded the requests sitting
  on its own boundary — the values latency bounds are most often written to.
  The graph exporter also kept its `le` labels in a second, hand-written array
  beside the bounds that drive bucketing; the labels are now derived from
  those bounds, so the two cannot drift. (#2106)

- **`PathScorer::score_rel_types` charges one decay factor per hop.** It raised
  `distance_decay` to the hop's ordinal, compounding to `decay^(n(n+1)/2)`,
  while `score_length` on the same path returned `decay^n` and the
  `distance_decay` field documents "each hop reduces score by 20%". At five
  hops with the default 0.8 the two functions answered 0.035 and 0.328 — a
  ninefold gap between two documented spellings of one contract. (#2106)

- **The scalar distance baseline computes the same metric as production.**
  `CpuDistance` exists to be the un-vectorized reference the SIMD kernels are
  checked against, and it implemented different formulas: Hamming compared raw
  bit patterns instead of bucketing at the 0.5 binary threshold (so `[1,2,3]`
  against `[4,5,6]` scored 3 where production scores 0), and Jaccard called an
  empty union maximally distant where production calls it identical. A
  reference that disagrees with its subject makes a real SIMD bug and a
  reference bug indistinguishable. All three non-Euclidean metrics now
  delegate to the scalar kernels production falls back on — which also gives
  cosine the `[-1, 1]` clamp the hand-rolled copy omitted — and a parity test
  pins baseline against SIMD across adversarial inputs. Euclidean still
  differs on purpose: the hot path returns squared L2. The unused
  `simd_distance_for_metric` dispatch was removed; its `dead_code`
  justification claimed a caller it did not have, and it disagreed with the
  hot path on Euclidean, so reusing it would have silently changed that
  contract. (#2106)

- **AVX-512 detection now requires the AVX2 + FMA baseline it falls back on.**
  `detect_simd_level` granted `SimdLevel::Avx512` on `avx512f` alone, but the
  dispatcher is not a strict hierarchy: an AVX-512 arm with no kernel for the
  input width falls through to the AVX2 kernel — Hamming and Jaccard below 16
  elements, and `scale_inplace` throughout — and those carry
  `#[target_feature(enable = "avx2")]`. Their safety contract was met by an ISA
  folk theorem ("Avx512 implies Avx2 support", as the SAFETY comment put it)
  rather than by a check. Every shipping AVX-512 part does advertise AVX2, so
  no physical CPU was affected; a hypervisor masking CPUID need not, and the
  failure there is an illegal instruction. Detection now requires `avx2` and
  `fma` for both non-scalar levels, which makes the fall-through sound by
  construction and the `SimdLevel::Avx512` doc true. (#2106)

- **`TRAIN QUANTIZER ... TYPE opq` is refused on Hamming and Jaccard
  collections.** OPQ keeps its codes in a rotated basis and the rescore path
  rotates the query to match. A rotation preserves inner products and norms,
  so cosine, Euclidean and dot product survive it — Hamming and Jaccard are
  defined component by component on the original axes, and a rotated "binary"
  vector is not binary at all. The combination trained happily and every later
  rescore measured the metric in a space where it means nothing. The rule now
  lives on the metric as `DistanceMetric::is_rotation_invariant`, mirroring the
  guard `train_sq8` already had. A codebook trained before this guard is still
  on disk somewhere, so open-time restore applies the same rule: a rotated
  `codebook.pq` on such a collection is not installed and the collection scores
  exact f32, the warn-and-degrade the dimension-mismatch arm beside it already
  used. Plain PQ has no rotation and stays available for these metrics.
  (#2106)

- **Clearing a point's text now takes it out of full-text search.** The BM25
  index only ever saw the incoming payload, so a payload that still existed but
  no longer yielded indexable text wrote nothing and the point kept matching a
  term its payload no longer contains. `add_document` replaces the previous
  version, so *changing* the text was always correct — only *clearing* it went
  stale, on every write path. The rule is now stated once and applied from the
  old payload as well as the new: a point is searchable exactly when its current
  payload yields indexable text. A point that never carried text is still not
  written to the index, so a bulk load of text-free vectors costs nothing — that
  is what deciding on the old payload buys over removing whenever there is no
  text. A repeated id inside one batch resolves to the batch's own earlier
  occurrence, matching the label path. (#2112)

- **A bulk upsert no longer leaves a point indexed under labels it dropped.**
  Both bulk paths indexed the incoming payload and never removed the old
  labels, on the recorded assumption that "for the bulk path, points are
  always new inserts (no old payload to remove from the label index)". The
  same functions collect the pre-batch payloads for histogram decrements, so
  overwrites plainly reach them: after `upsert_bulk` changed a point's
  `_labels` from `Doc` to `Archived`, it stayed indexed under **both**, and
  `MATCH (d:Doc)` returned a point that is no longer a `Doc`. The
  single-upsert path has always done remove-then-index; the bulk paths now
  run the same sequence through the same helpers. Three shapes were wrong and
  are each pinned: a changed label, a payload that drops labels entirely (the
  early return asked only whether *incoming* points carried `_labels`, so it
  never reached the loop), and a label carried on both sides of the update
  (removal must precede indexing or it is added and taken straight back out).
  `upsert_bulk_from_raw` had the identical gap — it already hands the old
  payloads to the secondary indexes, and the label index was the one left
  out. (#2112)

- **`NOT (similarity(...) AND metadata)` no longer drops the rows it should
  return.** The `NOT similarity()` scan inverted the similarity leaf and
  separately pushed the metadata leaves down through
  `extract_metadata_filter` — which wraps what it finds under a `NOT` in its
  own `NOT` — then AND-ed the two. That distributes the negation over the
  connective, which is De Morgan's error: `NOT (A AND B)` was executed as
  `NOT A AND NOT B`. On a three-row fixture the correct `[2, 3]` came back as
  `[]`, and `NOT (A OR B)` returned `[2, 3]` where `[3]` was correct. Neither
  raised an error. The scan now decides each candidate with
  `evaluate_where_condition_for_record`, the same evaluator the graph and
  aggregation paths use, so the engine has one WHERE semantics rather than one
  per execution path; the similarity leaf is still extracted, but only to
  score the rows that pass. A stale comment in `extraction.rs` recorded the
  assumption that broke — "NOT similarity() is rejected earlier in
  validation" — which stopped being true when EPIC-044 US-003 enabled the
  full-scan path. (#2112)

- **WHERE now evaluates in three-valued logic.** A `similarity()` predicate is
  UNKNOWN for a row whose vector cannot be scored (length mismatch, empty, or
  absent), where it previously answered `false`. The two are indistinguishable
  until something negates them: `NOT false` admits the row, `NOT UNKNOWN` must
  not, so the old answer let `NOT similarity()` return rows nothing had been
  computed for. `AND` and `OR` follow Kleene's tables and keep short-circuiting
  on the value that decides them (`false` for `AND`, `true` for `OR`), and a
  top-level UNKNOWN excludes the row exactly as SQL's `WHERE` does. One
  consequence is a row that is now *returned* where it used to be dropped:
  under `NOT (unscoreable AND meta)` with `meta` false, the conjunction is
  false whatever the vector would have scored, so the negation is a known
  true. Documented in `docs/VELESQL_SPEC.md`. (#2112)

- **`ANALYZE` no longer returns wrong points on collections over 1 000
  vectors.** `analyze_collection` runs `reorder_for_locality()`, which
  renumbers every graph node — and `HnswIndex`'s external-id mappings are
  keyed by that numbering, so they were left pointing at whatever vector had
  moved into each slot. Nothing failed: every lookup still resolved, to the
  wrong point. On a 1 100-point Euclidean collection a self-query's correct
  top-5 `[500, 501, 499, 502, 498]` came back as `[575, 601, 586, 560, 588]`
  after `ANALYZE`. `vacuum` renumbers too and has always rebuilt the mappings;
  the reorder path never did. It now remaps both directions under the index
  write lock, so a search cannot observe the half-renumbered state. Affects
  every storage mode. (#2112)

- **A quantized collection no longer loses its search quality to `ANALYZE`.**
  The `SQ8` and `RaBitQ` backends index their code store positionally — entry
  N holds node N's code — and the reorder dispatch went straight to the inner
  graph, leaving every code describing a different node. Traversal then walked
  a graph scored on unrelated codes while the exact-f32 re-rank reported
  honest distances for whatever that walk reached, so no error surfaced
  anywhere: measured through the int8 path at 2 000 x 64-d, recall@10 went
  from 1.000 to **0.000** (RaBitQ: 0.025). The quantized backends now own
  their reorder and rebuild the store in the new node order, under the same
  install gate that protects a quantizer install. (#2112)

- **A BFS reorder no longer silently un-does the file-backed arena.**
  `ContiguousVectors::reorder` gathered into a fresh heap buffer and swapped
  the backing to `Heap`, so the first `reorder_for_locality()` on a quantized
  collection put the f32 arena back into anonymous RSS, gave up the 61% cut,
  released the mapping and its exclusive lock, and turned `flush_backing()`
  into a no-op that still returned `Ok`. The permutation is now applied in
  place by rotating each cycle through one vector of scratch, so the backing
  survives, `capacity` is no longer shrunk to `count`, and the peak
  allocation during a reorder is the arena rather than twice it. At
  100 000 x 768-d that is 0.044-0.060 s against 0.158-0.209 s for the copying
  shape (eight runs), with no 293 MiB second buffer. A `new_order` that repeats an index is
  now rejected instead of silently duplicating one vector and dropping
  another. (#2112)

- **A vector that can't be scored is excluded, not scored 0.0.** Every
  `similarity()` path fell back to `0.0` when the candidate and query
  vectors had different lengths — but for a distance metric (Euclidean,
  Hamming) `0.0` is a *perfect* match, so `WHERE similarity(v, $q) > t`
  admitted the malformed candidate as the single most similar point in
  the collection, and `ORDER BY` ranked it first. The fallback is gone
  from all four sites: `compute_metric_score` now returns `Option<f32>`,
  and the similarity filter, the `NOT similarity()` scan, the graph-
  predicate WHERE evaluator and the anchored exact scan each drop the
  candidate. `ORDER BY similarity()` keeps its existing metric-aware
  worst sentinel. (#2106)

- **Jaccard scores come back as similarities on every HNSW path.** The
  HNSW score transform passed the engine's `1 - jaccard` traversal
  distance through while the metric is declared higher-is-better, so the
  bitmap-filtered, brute-force-parallel, dual-precision/RaBitQ rerank and
  delta-merge paths ranked the *worst* candidates first and disagreed
  with the exact path on the same query. (#2100)

- **The GraphFirst filtered scan stopped clamping every metric into
  [-1, 1].** Euclidean/Hamming distances and raw dot products beyond 1
  collapsed into an artificial 1.0 tie (arbitrary top-k, meaningless
  score) and the clamp never removed the NaN it claimed to guard; NaN
  scores now map to the metric's worst key instead. (#2101)

- **Score-level fusion honors score polarity.** Average, Maximum,
  Weighted and RSF fused Euclidean/Hamming distance branches as if
  higher were better — inverted or degenerate fused rankings across
  multi-query, `NEAR_FUSED`, hybrid dense+sparse and dense+text. Branch
  polarity is now declared via `fusion::ScoreDirection`, derived from
  the metric. (#2102)

- **SIMD cosine no longer zeroes small-magnitude vectors.** The shared
  finish step guarded on the *product* of squared norms against
  `EPSILON²`, so vectors with norms around 3.4e-4 scored 0.0 on
  AVX2/AVX-512/NEON while the scalar path returned the true cosine.
  (#2103)

- **The RaBitQ estimator is de-biased by the arcsine law.** The
  symmetric binary inner product satisfies `E[ip] = 1 - 2θ/π`, not
  `cos θ`; using it raw overestimated every non-zero angle's distance
  (+15% at 60°) and distorted cross-norm ranking. (#2104)

- **Storage latency percentiles use nearest-rank.** The floor-based
  target reported 1µs for any window where `count × p < 100` — a single
  500ms mmap resize was invisible to the P99 monitoring it exists for.
  (#2105)

- **The circuit breaker could deadlock the whole service under load.**
  `check()` held `opened_at` (read) while asking for `state` (write) and
  `record_failure()` held `state` (write) while asking for `opened_at`
  (write) — opposite orders on two paths the query pipeline calls on every
  request, so an open breaker under concurrent traffic could wedge both.
  The two values now live under one lock, which makes the conflicting order
  unrepresentable; `clippy::significant_drop_in_scrutinee` is promoted to
  `deny` so the shape cannot return, and the 17 other guards that spanned a
  `match`/`if let`/`for` expression (including two held across a disk write
  in `flush_secondary_indexes`, and the collection-cache lookups whose disk
  fallback takes the same map for write) are bound before the expression.
  (#2109, #2110)

## [5.2.0] - 2026-08-22

### Changed

- **The cosine hot path runs on the pre-normalized kernel.** Vectors are
  unit-norm at insert (and normalized on legacy load behind an epsilon gate
  that keeps already-unit vectors bitwise intact), so production HNSW now
  scores cosine as `1 - dot` — one FMA chain instead of three plus a
  sqrt/div — at every traversal, rerank, and recovery comparison site.
  Recovery pass 3 compares bytes on the normalized form, preserving its
  exactness contract. (#2058)

- **Every WAL write path pays one durability barrier per batch, not one per
  point.** BM25, sparse and payload batch APIs append their whole batch and
  sync once; frame encodings are byte-identical to N single appends, so
  existing logs replay unchanged. (#2059)

- **The query row loops stopped re-deriving per-query invariants.** MATCH
  payload reads are memoized per query behind the storage guards; WHERE
  metadata leaves compile once per query instead of once per row; the WHERE
  similarity loop hoists its vector/metric snapshot; and the payload log no
  longer issues an `fstat` per read. (#2060, #2066, #2068)

- **MATCH planning reads O(1) statistics.** Edge and label counts come from
  maintained counters instead of full scans, and the planner honors the CSR
  rebuild debounce instead of forcing rebuilds on read. GraphMatch
  selectivity is costed from the ANALYZE graph view instead of a 0.5
  constant. (#2061, #2048)

- **Filtered search allocates and hydrates less.** Secondary-index lookups
  serve prebuilt roaring buckets folded smallest-first; vector hydration is
  deferred to the k survivors of the score sort; candidate scans stream in
  bounded chunks; cache hits on `CollectionStats` share an `Arc` instead of
  deep-cloning the stats tree. (#2063, #2064, #2065)

- **JOIN stopped deep-cloning its left rows.** The PK ColumnStore join is
  1:1 by construction, so joined rows now *move* their left `SearchResult`
  (vector included) instead of copying it; the indexed non-PK join builds a
  real grouped hash-join side — one index lookup per distinct key, one
  batched hydration — instead of one lookup per row; and the JOIN-side
  ColumnStore is cached keyed by collection generation. (#2042, #2067)

- **`flush()` rewrites only what changed.** Property and range index files
  key off dirty flags, the edge-store snapshot keys off WAL emptiness
  (an empty WAL proves store == snapshot), and clean sparse indexes skip
  compaction — O(batch) per flush instead of O(total edges + postings).
  Crash ordering (snapshot before WAL truncate) is unchanged and pinned by
  the recovery suites. (#2072)

- **Reverse graph traversals resolve through a composite index.**
  `incoming_by_label` mirrors the outgoing index, so `<-[:TYPE]-` patterns
  and `Direction::Both` expansions are O(matching edges) instead of
  cloning the whole in-neighborhood; the field is rebuilt at load
  (`serde(skip)`), leaving `edge_store.bin` byte-compatible. (#2071)

- **The vector mmap advises `MADV_RANDOM`** at map and at every
  capacity-growth remap, so HNSW's random access pattern stops paying
  kernel readahead for pages search never touches. (#2070)

- **Brute-force scans partial-sort to top-k** (`select_nth_unstable` +
  sort of the k survivors) instead of fully sorting candidate sets, and
  `ORDER BY` on plain payload fields decorates each row once instead of
  re-walking payload JSON inside the comparator. (#2069)

- **Three small hot-path allocation fixes**: the delta-buffer merge uses
  `FxHashSet`, `ShardedIndex::len()` reads a maintained atomic counter
  instead of walking 16 shard locks, and the HNSW graph writer serializes
  neighbors through a reused scratch buffer — byte-identical output.
  (#2073)

- **The adaptive escalation resumes instead of restarting.** When the
  spread heuristic escalates a hard query, phase 2 re-enters the phase-1
  traversal (visited set and frontier carried over) under the widened ef
  instead of re-running from scratch — measured 27% fewer distance
  evaluations at exact recall parity on the deterministic harness, which
  now runs in CI next to the cost-crossover suite. GPU and RaBitQ paths
  keep their restart semantics. (#2080)

- **The ColumnStore string dictionary interns each string once** — both
  interning maps share a single `Arc<str>` allocation per entry instead of
  storing every string twice. (#2081)

### Added

- **Inner/Left JOINs on a non-primary join column are served from a
  secondary index** when one exists on the right collection, instead of
  falling back to a full scan. (#2049)

- **The runtime filter-selectivity estimate is backed by ANALYZE
  statistics** instead of static heuristics, feeding the pre/post-filter
  decision brain. (#2046)

- **CI: the fuzz seed corpus is committed and replayed on every PR**, and a
  crash found by the nightly job now fails it; nightly Miri extends to the
  manual-allocation core. Four consumer feature combinations gate every PR,
  and manifests are checked against the public registries daily. (#2027,
  #2032, #2033, #2051, #2052)

### Deprecated

- **The `MemoryStore` alias** (velesdb-memory) is deprecated; its napi
  homonym is renamed. (#2035)

### Removed

- **The PDX block-columnar machinery.** It was maintained on every insert,
  rebuilt on optimize (2x vector RAM), and read by nothing; the search loop
  it fed was reclaimed, and `NATIVE_HNSW.md` now documents the
  pre-normalized kernel that production actually runs. Recoverable from git
  history if the design returns. (#2062, #2074)

### Fixed

- **The hybrid dense+sparse metadata filter now binds BOTH branches — and
  the REST endpoint finally reads it at all.** Two layered defects: the
  server's `/search` hybrid dense+sparse path never read the request's
  `filter` (silently returning unfiltered fused results), and even when a
  filter reached core's `execute_both_branches` (the VelesQL hybrid path),
  only the sparse branch applied it — dense-only candidates the filter
  excludes leaked into fusion. The dense branch now routes through the
  filtered dense search (bitmap pre-filter + oversampling), the facade
  gains `hybrid_sparse_search_filtered`, and the server wires the request
  filter through it. A facade test pins that no fused result can carry an
  excluded point.

- **The REST weighted-fusion defaults rejoin the #1545 canon.** The REST
  surface froze the pre-#1545 weights (0.5/0.3/0.2) in two places — the
  `api_types` serde defaults and the server's strategy parser — while
  every other surface used the canonical 0.6/0.3/0.1 from core's fusion
  module. Both now derive from the canonical constants; a weightless
  `strategy: "weighted"` REST request behaves like the same request on
  every other surface. Behavioral change for REST clients that relied on
  the forked defaults: pass explicit weights to keep the old blend.

- **TS SDK: REST `upsert`/`upsertBatch` no longer drop `sparseVector`.**
  The REST backend sent only `{id, vector, payload}` while the server
  accepts `sparse_vector` and the streaming backend always forwarded it —
  a sparse-carrying upsert silently produced an empty sparse index and
  degraded hybrid search. Both paths now forward it; wire-body tests pin
  the contract.

- **The bitmap under-fill retry explored nothing.** It doubled
  `candidates_k` at the same `ef`, but the graph's result heap is bounded
  by `ef`, so the retry re-ran the identical traversal and returned the
  identical set — pure cost. The retry now widens `ef` as well, and a
  regression test pins both the old no-op mechanism and the new deeper
  exploration. (#2080)

- **`[wal_batch]` no longer promises group commit it does not deliver.**
  The section is parsed but unwired; enabling it now logs a warning, the
  rustdoc marks it reserved, and both example TOMLs stop describing it as
  functional. Wiring or removal is tracked in #2078. (#2082)

- **Package descriptions claim sub-millisecond, not microsecond**, and the
  benchmarks licence notice is corrected. (#2041)

### Changed

- **The executed-strategy channel is now a typed cell.** The
  `Arc<AtomicU8>` probe introduced with `executed_filter_strategy` spread
  its raw `u8` encoding across three modules; it is now
  `guardrails::ExecutedStrategyCell`, whose encoding is a private detail —
  callers only `record` a `FilterStrategy` and `get` an `Option` back. The
  counted (EXPLAIN ANALYZE) executions also return a named
  `CountedExecution` struct instead of a 4-tuple, and the Database-level
  counted path shares its pre-flight (`execute_query_gated`: subquery
  resolution, validation, read gate, timed execution) with the plain path
  instead of replaying a copy — the two can no longer drift. The executor's
  dispatch match is spelled out with no wildcard arm: a future
  `FilterStrategy` variant fails compilation at every site that must choose,
  instead of silently falling into a default. No behavior change.

### Added

- **The cost-crossover harness measures two corpus geometries.** The original
  closed-form trigonometric corpus lies on a smooth 1-D curve — a degenerate
  distribution an HNSW graph finds unusually easy, so its numbers alone could
  flatter the index. A seeded isotropic corpus (inline xorshift64*, no RNG
  dependency, so the sequence can never change under a dependency bump) now
  runs the same band table; every exact law must hold on both. First
  measured correction: on the isotropic corpus the bitmap path's work
  advantage over post-filter at 50–80 % selectivity collapses (≈4 % instead
  of ≈36 %), and at 5 % selectivity bitmap-HNSW costs nearly 2× the
  post-filter — the oversampling budget `k/selectivity` dominates. The
  threshold-convergence work must weigh both geometries.

- **EXPLAIN ANALYZE now reports the filter strategy the executor actually
  ran** (`actual_stats.executed_filter_strategy`), recorded at the dispatch
  site itself — not re-derived — through a probe shared between the query
  context and the search options (an atomic slot, so the vector leg of the
  CBO `Parallel` strategy, which runs on a rayon worker, records correctly).
  Present for single SELECTs that went through the filtered vector-search
  dispatch (including the new `PreFilterExact` brute-force branch); omitted
  for MATCH, compound queries, and arms where pre/post-filter does not
  apply. Unlike the plan's `filter_strategy` (an estimate), this is ground
  truth: comparing the two surfaces plan/execution divergence — e.g. the
  no-override path runs the bitmap even at 90 % selectivity where the
  override path post-filters. Serde-defaulted: stats persisted by older
  versions load unchanged.

- **Deterministic cost-crossover harness** (`tests/cost_crossover.rs`, nightly
  `cost-crossover` CI job): measures the *work* (single-pair distance
  evaluations, via a new `internal-bench`-gated counter) and the exact recall
  of each filtered-search execution shape on a fully deterministic corpus —
  closed-form vectors, fixed-seed HNSW level PRNG, selectivities exact by
  construction straddling the `0.01`/`0.8` dispatch thresholds. Counts are
  bit-for-bit reproducible across runs and machines, so the numbers are
  comparable between commits even on shared CI runners where wall-clock
  benchmarks are noise. The printed JSON table is the measurement feed for
  the planner-threshold convergence work; the harness asserts only exact
  laws (determinism, scan work = bitmap cardinality, post-filter work
  independent of selectivity, strict `0.8` boundary). Release builds carry
  zero instrumentation.

### Changed

- **The pre/post-filter decision now has a single brain:
  `velesql::decide_filter_strategy`.** The executor's bitmap dispatch
  (`collection/search/vector_filter.rs`) and EXPLAIN's plan-time strategy
  (`velesql/explain/filter_strategy.rs`) each owned their own thresholds; the
  executor's `0.01` / `0.8` cutoffs now live next to the plan-time recall
  guard and both consumers call the same pure function —
  `FilterDecisionMode::Exact` for the measured bitmap ratio,
  `FilterDecisionMode::Estimated` for the cost-model comparison. A new
  `FilterStrategy::PreFilterExact` variant names the executor's brute-force
  branch (exact scan of the bitmap survivors), which the estimated mode never
  promises. Zero behavior change: every dispatch boundary and every EXPLAIN
  output is bit-for-bit what it was.
- **`velesql::match_planner::CollectionStats` is renamed `MatchGraphStats`**;
  the old name remains as a deprecated type alias, so callers compile
  unchanged. The old name collided with the tabular
  `collection::stats::CollectionStats` while sharing no field with it. The
  graph-shape view is now also filled by `ANALYZE` into
  `CollectionStats::graph_stats` (optional, serde-defaulted — stats files
  persisted by older versions load unchanged), giving the MATCH planner and
  the cost estimator one shared source for graph statistics.
- **The promise contract now fails the build when a documentary claim was
  measured a full major behind the shipping workspace.** Minor drift stays
  advisory (unchanged), but a figure taken on a previous major describes a
  product that no longer ships — both real drifts this guard exists for
  crossed exactly that line. A claim may carry an explicit, dated
  `stale_accepted` waiver scoped to the current workspace major
  (self-expiring at the next major bump); the two 4.0.0-era size claims
  carry one until the next release build re-measures them.

### Fixed

- **`GEO_DISTANCE(...) = threshold` / `<>` now tolerates realistic
  floating-point noise instead of demanding near bit-exact equality.** The
  distance is computed via several `sin`/`cos`/`sqrt`/`atan2` calls
  (`haversine_distance_m`), so `f64::EPSILON` — the ULP at magnitude 1.0 — was
  far tighter than the actual precision at real-world distances (meters),
  making `Eq`/`NotEq` on `GEO_DISTANCE` spuriously fail for values that were,
  for all practical purposes, equal. The comparator now scales the epsilon by
  the compared magnitudes, matching the relative-epsilon fix already applied
  to the `HAVING` threshold comparator (`aggregation/having.rs`).
- **A failed PQ (Product Quantization) training pass or codebook save is now
  logged instead of silently discarded.** `cache_pq_vector` trains the
  quantizer once its buffer reaches `PQ_TRAINING_SAMPLES`, then drains that
  buffer unconditionally; a training failure (e.g. degenerate input) left the
  quantizer permanently unset and threw the accumulated samples away with no
  operator-visible signal — the collection silently ran without PQ
  quantization from then on. `save_codebook`'s failure was swallowed the same
  way, silently leaving the quantizer working in memory but unpersisted
  across restarts. Both now emit a `tracing::warn!` with the underlying error.
- **A panic in a binding no longer aborts the host process (mobile + Node,
  #1980).** Mobile release builds now use the new `release-mobile` workspace
  profile (`panic = "unwind"`, mirroring `release-node`), so UniFFI's
  `catch_unwind` trampolines can convert a Rust panic — including the one
  UniFFI raises when a Swift/Kotlin callback throws unexpectedly — into a
  catchable foreign exception instead of a SIGABRT of the whole app. On the
  Node side, the async task path (`Job::compute`) now catches panics itself:
  napi's async trampoline is a plain `extern "C"` call with no net of its own,
  so a panicking background job aborted the Node process even under the
  `release-node` unwind profile. It now rejects the Promise with an
  `[INTERNAL]` error carrying the panic message.
- **Server: an unbounded `top_k` on hybrid search no longer aborts the
  process.** The hybrid/fused search path reserved `BinaryHeap::with_capacity(k
  + 1)` from the caller-supplied `top_k`, which is unclamped there (unlike the
  dense path). A large value in a `POST /collections/{c}/search/hybrid` body
  requested a terabyte-scale allocation; the allocation failure calls
  `handle_alloc_error`, which aborts the whole server rather than failing the
  request. The reservation is now bounded by the candidate count
  (`min(k, candidates) + 1`), which changes no result — the heap still trims to
  `top_k`.
- **Server: HTTPS + rate limiting now work together.** The manual TLS accept
  path built its hyper service without injecting `ConnectInfo<SocketAddr>`, so
  the rate limiter's `SmartIpKeyExtractor` could not extract a key and returned
  `500` for every HTTPS request that carried no
  `X-Forwarded-For`/`X-Real-Ip`/`Forwarded` header — i.e. every normal REST
  client. Since TLS is the recommended production step and rate limiting is on
  by default, the two were unusable together. The TLS path now inserts
  `ConnectInfo` per request, exactly as the plaintext path's
  `into_make_service_with_connect_info` does.
- **Collection config write now fsyncs the parent directory (power-loss
  durability).** `save_config` fsynced the temp file and renamed it atomically,
  but never fsynced the directory, so the rename of `config.json` — which is
  authoritative and non-reconstructible (HNSW params, storage mode, advanced
  config) — was not guaranteed durable. A power loss right after creating or
  reconfiguring a collection could leave a data directory whose collection has
  no loadable config. The write now applies the same `sync_parent_directory`
  barrier `storage::atomic_write` uses everywhere else. Off the hot path.

- **Sparse-index WAL now fsyncs the acknowledged write (power-loss
  durability).** `wal_append_upsert` / `wal_append_delete` flushed the buffer
  but never `sync_all`ed, so an upsert carrying `sparse_vectors` could be
  acknowledged while its bytes sat only in the OS page cache — and sparse
  vectors are stored nowhere else, so a power loss before the next compaction
  lost them silently. The append path now shares the BM25 and edge WALs'
  durability discipline (a single `flush` + `sync_all` per acked append). A
  process crash was already safe; this closes the power-loss / kernel-panic
  window.
- **WASM: a metadata filter with an unrecognized or missing condition `type`
  now matches nothing instead of everything (#1975).** `search_with_filter`'s
  evaluator returned `true` for any `"type"` it did not recognize, so a typo'd
  operator (`"eqals"`) — or a condition object with no `"type"` at all —
  silently returned unfiltered results. Both now fail closed. An absent
  `filter`, or a filter without a `condition` key, still matches everything:
  "no filter" and "a filter the evaluator cannot interpret" are different
  claims, and only the second one is an error.

## [5.1.0] — 2026-08-19

### Security

- **`h2` 0.4.14 → 0.4.16 (RUSTSEC-2026-0258, #1976).** The HTTP/2
  dependency carried a published advisory; `cargo deny check advisories`
  is clean again on this release.

### Added

- **`velesdb-memory` can re-embed its live store online (#1796).** The daemon
  now owns snapshot copy, bounded durable mutation capture, measured catch-up,
  budgeted cutover, crash recovery, and safe cancellation through four MCP
  tools. The offline `migrate-embeddings` command remains available when an
  outage is acceptable.

### Changed

- **HTTP inference features are named by role (#1766).** `embedder-http` and
  `extractor-http` are now the canonical build features. The former `ollama`
  and `extract` names remain compatibility aliases, so existing dependency
  declarations continue to compile unchanged.

- **Python SDK: the result-count option is `k` everywhere (#1921).**
  `SearchOptions(top_k=…)` and `.with_top_k(…)` are now `SearchOptions(k=…)`
  and `.with_k(…)`, aligning the Python surface with the `k` every other
  binding and the MCP tools already use. *Migration*: replace `top_k=` with
  `k=` and `with_top_k(` with `with_k(` — the semantics are unchanged.

- **Every inline test module moved beside its file (#1918).** 173 files —
  22,805 lines of `#[cfg(test)] mod` blocks across all ten crates — now live
  in sibling `*_tests.rs` files (twelve PRs, #1994–#2005), with shrink-only
  baselines freezing both the inline-test debt (#1971) and production file
  budgets (#1974), a durability-barrier guard on file-creating write paths
  (#1990), and a hygiene gate (typos, taplo, cargo-machete) wired into
  `CI Success` (#1989). Production code and test behavior are unchanged; a
  `.git-blame-ignore-revs` keeps `git blame` readable across the campaign.

- **Superfluous `unsafe Send/Sync` impls removed from core (#1982),** with
  the remaining ones re-documented against their actual guards and a
  fail-closed doctrine written where reviewers look for it.

### Fixed

- **Python and Node bindings now read `VELESDB_MEMORY_EMBEDDER*` and gain the
  `openai` backend (#1886).** The embedder was documented everywhere as an
  environment-variable choice, but only the MCP daemon actually read one:
  `MemoryService(path)` on Python and `MemoryService.open(path)` on Node
  silently used the offline `hash` embedder regardless of
  `VELESDB_MEMORY_EMBEDDER`, and `openai` did not exist as a binding-level
  backend at all. Both bindings now resolve the backend through the same
  `velesdb_memory::select_embedder`/`embedder_env_endpoint` the daemon uses
  (moved into the library, `crates/velesdb-memory/src/remote_endpoint.rs`),
  with an explicit constructor argument always winning over the environment.
  `openai`'s URL and credential are read from the environment only — never a
  constructor argument — matching the rule already enforced for the daemon.
  *Migration*: Python's `embedder` constructor argument default changed from
  the literal `"hash"` to `None`; passing `embedder="hash"` explicitly is
  unaffected, and `None`/omitted now falls back to `VELESDB_MEMORY_EMBEDDER`
  before defaulting to `hash`.

- **CLI: a failed flush after a REPL `upsert` or payload-store write is now
  reported instead of swallowed (#1950).** The two fixed call sites were the
  only remaining swallowed flushes in the CLI. Community contribution.

- **Snapshot publication is power-loss durable (#1900, closes #1897).**
  `atomic_write` fsyncs the directory entry after the rename — success now
  means the *replacement* is durable, not just the file contents — and
  sparse compaction promotes its `idx`/`terms`/`meta` generation through one
  durable commit point, keeping the WAL recoverable until that point is on
  disk. A restart observes either the previous complete generation plus its
  WAL or the new complete generation, never a mixture.

- **Concurrent HNSW inserts can no longer orphan a stored fact (#1907,
  #1908).** When two single-point inserts reserved mapping indices in one
  order and the graph assigned node IDs in another, reconciliation removed
  a reverse mapping by index alone — deleting another insert's valid
  mapping and leaving a successfully stored fact unreachable from vector
  search (one write in ten under the concurrent regression test). Removal
  is now conditional on the slot still belonging to the insertion being
  corrected.

- **Two API-reachable crash/DoS vectors closed in the server (#1979).** An
  unbounded `top_k` could abort the process on allocation, and enabling TLS
  together with rate limiting turned every HTTPS request into a 500.

- **A panic inside a binding no longer aborts the host process (#1992).**
  Node and mobile hosts see a structured error instead of a hard abort.

- **WASM: three reachable-from-JS defects closed.** A RaBitQ configuration
  crash and a metadata filter that silently matched everything on an
  unrecognized condition — now fail-closed (#1977, #1975) — and a
  size-overflowing v1 import is rejected instead of truncating, with
  saturating capacity hints (#1986).

- **Durability barriers on two write paths (#1978, #1985).** The
  sparse-index WAL is fsynced on the acknowledged append, and the parent
  directory is fsynced after `config.json`'s rename — an acknowledged write
  now survives power loss on both paths.

- **Lexical-embedder fallback is surfaced instead of silent
  (velesdb-memory #1911),** and the scalar wire tolerance is aligned with
  the documented schema claim (velesdb-memory #1938).

### Changed (velesdb-memory 0.14.0, released alongside)

- The memory crate ships its 17/08 review wave: the error surface frozen
  for semver (`#[non_exhaustive]` + per-adapter category guards on the
  Node, Python and WASM bindings, #1960), all HTTP clients on one bounded
  `ureq` agent (#1961), a structured `WorkingContextCodec` error (#1963),
  and the daemon binary split from a 1708-line `main.rs` into four modules
  (#1964).

- On top of that wave, 0.14.0 splits the 22-method `MemoryStore` trait
  into four facets — `FactStore`, `RecallStore`, `GraphStore`,
  `ColumnStore` (#1959, breaking for out-of-tree *implementors* only;
  callers compile unchanged via the `MemoryStore` supertrait alias) — adds
  an honest `MemoryError::Unsupported`/`ErrorCategory::Unsupported` for
  backend capability gaps, and corrects the working-context index lock's
  false cross-process claim: a second process fails at open with
  `DatabaseLocked` before any read-modify-write, now proven by a
  two-daemon process test (#1958, #2011). Details and the implementor
  migration in `crates/velesdb-memory/CHANGELOG.md`.

## [5.0.0] — 2026-08-10

### Added — the concurrency sweep and the inspection surface (2026-08-09/10)

- **`memory_status` — the server's health becomes readable inside the protocol
  (#1863).** The hash-embedder warning went to stderr of a stdio server, and
  every mainstream MCP client swallows that stream: a user on the default
  build experienced "recall is bad", never saw why, and could not ask. One
  tool now reports which embedder RUNS and whether recall is semantic, what
  the store was FILLED by per its on-disk provenance record, the extraction
  and autograph wiring, and the corpus size — `memory.edges: 0` is the
  observable "why() has nothing to walk" state. `get_info` additionally
  appends a degraded-mode note to the server instructions when the declared
  embedder is `hash` — the one channel a client is required to read.
- **`list_memories` and `velesdb-memory export` — the store becomes auditable
  (#1866).** "What does my agent know?" is the question `recall` structurally
  cannot answer: it ranks by resemblance to a query, and what resembles
  nothing you thought to ask stays invisible. `list_memories` walks every
  live fact page by page (ids ascending, TTL-expired skipped, metadata under
  recall's visibility rule, a metadata filter that never breaks the walk);
  the `export` CLI subcommand writes the same walk as JSONL and is
  deliberately **embedder-free** — no embedder is built and no provenance
  check runs, so the one store the daemon refuses to SERVE (a provenance
  mismatch) is still the user's to READ. It also refuses a missing store
  path outright rather than letting the engine create an empty one there.
- **The bindings hold the same inspection surface (#1867).** `memoryStatus`/
  `listMemories` on Node and `memory_status`/`list_memories` on Python return
  the same envelopes as the MCP tools, built from the same service accessors;
  the four parity exemptions recorded on the way were DELETED, which the
  stale-exemption guard enforces the moment a binding implements a tool it
  was exempted from. WASM keeps its structural exemptions.
- **The embedder-switch journey is pinned end to end (#1864).** Each layer
  already carried its own proof (provenance refuses; the journaled migration
  re-embeds under original ids; recall works) but no suite walked the CHAIN.
  One integration test now does: facts under `hash`, the flip refused WITH
  the `migrate-embeddings` pointer, the pointed-at migration re-embedding
  and switching over at the source's own path, and the original fact
  recalled through the new embedder under its original id.

### Changed

- **The semantic backends ship in every artifact — the choice is
  runtime-only (#1862).** `ollama` and `extract` joined the default features:
  `cargo install velesdb-memory` and the `.mcpb` registry bundle (the
  one-click path whose users cannot rebuild) now carry both HTTP backends,
  so switching to real semantic recall or model-based extraction is an
  env-var change, never a rebuild. The runtime default stays `hash` — fully
  offline, nothing contacted unless the user opts in. Cost: one small HTTP
  client, +482 KiB measured. An ungated runtime pin fails every
  default-features suite if either feature leaves the defaults again.
- **The onboarding tells the truth and recommends `bge-m3` (#1865).** README
  step 2 carries the honest caveat inline (the out-of-the-box default matches
  surface form, not meaning), a "Real semantic recall in 5 minutes" section
  lands right after the 60-second setup, `MCP_SERVER_SETUP.md` names `bge-m3`
  as the recommended model, and the memory skill gains loop step 0: read
  `memory_status` once per session and tell the user when the server runs
  degraded.
- **No operation may wedge another — the stall-class sweep (#1861).** 22
  server handlers that ran lock-taking, fsync-bearing core calls inline on
  the tokio workers moved to the blocking pool (a `/health` probe behind 64
  concurrent INSERTs: waited for all 64 before, answers mid-wave at 17–24 ms
  after); batch delete pays one durability barrier per store instead of ~3
  fsyncs per point (8000-point delete: 45.4 s with a reader stalled 45.3 s →
  141 ms with the reader at 33 ms), keeping the delete-frame-before-punch
  invariant at batch granularity; the Tauri plugin stops serializing itself
  (all commands through `spawn_blocking`, state guards held only to clone an
  `Arc`); the working-index mutex no longer spans the embedding call; and
  Python's `train_pq`/`Collection.explain` release the GIL like the crate's
  other long paths.
- **Extraction generation is bounded (#1858).** Neither extraction backend
  capped completion tokens; the real graph-extraction prompt on a twelve-word
  sentence measured 3 933 tokens and 1 min 59 s unbounded, 14.9 s capped.
  `MAX_GENERATION_TOKENS = 512` now rides both backends (`num_predict` /
  `max_tokens`).

### Fixed

- **The lock audit's blocking findings — three deadlocks and a
  forget-resurrection, at the root (#1860).** `MobileGraphStore::save`'s
  ABBA ordering; MATCH's vector/payload lock inversion made impossible by
  construction (`MatchStorageGuards` — the compiler now rejects the wrong
  order); a permanently forgotten fact no longer resurrected by its stale
  autograph enrichment (the queued job re-checks liveness under the write
  path); and the application-level lock-ordering doc corrected where it
  overstated its guarantees. Plus the parity audit's corrections (#1859):
  caller-facing docs, guard pins and missing regression tests.

### Removed

- **`WalBatcher` leaves the public Rust API (#1861).** Zero call sites in
  the tree (`CORE_WIRING_DEBT` entry 1) yet shipped as public surface users
  could build on going into 5.0.0. Demoted to `pub(crate)`; code and tests
  kept intact pending the declared premium transfer. *Migration*: no known
  external users; a caller who did construct it should hold their own
  batching in front of `Database` writes, or ask for the surface back with
  the use case attached.


### Removed

- **`scripts/run-failure-injection-harness.sh` (#1708).** Zero references
  anywhere in the repository — no workflow, no hook, no doc — and the one
  test unique to it, `test_crash_recovery_insert_scenario`, is `#[ignore]`d;
  the script invoked it without `--include-ignored`, so even a manual run
  silently skipped the one thing it existed to prove. Its other two
  invocations (`test_multiple_corruptions`, `storage::wal_recovery_tests`)
  are plain `#[test]`s already covered by the standard
  `cargo test -p velesdb-core --features persistence` run. A harness nothing
  calls and that skips its own ignored test is not coverage — it is the same
  gap the required-guards audit (#1698) flagged, one layer further down.

### Added

- **A startup signal when the configured extraction backend cannot be reached
  (#1751).** `autograph` degrading in flight is the correct default — losing
  the enrichment beats losing the fact — but it degraded silently *forever*:
  an extractor broken by a migration looked exactly like a product that does
  not build a graph, with nothing said at startup or at the hundredth degraded
  write. The daemon now asks the backend once, at startup, and prints one line
  naming the role, the URL and the model. Four verdicts, because they lead to
  four different actions: unreachable, credential refused, answering without
  that model in its listing, or serving no listing at all. It **never refuses
  to boot** over it (unreachable is transient — a service manager can start
  this daemon before the model server) and **never falls back** to another
  backend. Silent when everything is fine. The probe reads the server's model
  listing (`GET /v1/models`, served by Ollama and by every OpenAI-compatible
  server), so it costs milliseconds and loads no model — asking a generation
  endpoint would have pulled a 35-billion-parameter model to answer "are you
  there".

- **`scripts/sync-agent-hooks.py` — an installer and a drift check for the
  Claude Code agent hooks.** The hooks a session actually runs live in
  `~/.claude/hooks/velesdb-memory/`, outside any repository, and they had
  diverged in *both* directions at once: the repository was ahead on the
  model-facing text (`session-start.sh` carried the corrected
  `{found, working, other_sessions}` guidance while the installed copy still
  said *"if it returns null, nothing was saved yet"* — an instruction that
  makes a model start fresh on top of work a mistyped session id hid from it),
  and the install was ahead on function (`lib/freshness.sh`,
  `update-daemon.sh`, and `jq` hardening that existed nowhere in the repo). The
  source absorbed the local layer first, so the installer is not destructive;
  both are now versioned, with no path from any one contributor's machine.
  Modes: `--check`, `--check --strict`, `--install`, `--install --dry-run`,
  `--uninstall`. It reports three states per artefact, merges at *hook*
  granularity because a foreign hook can share a group with ours, backs
  `settings.json` up before writing, replaces it atomically, and never prints
  its contents.
- **`integrations/agent-hooks/test/hooks.test.sh` runs in CI.** It was
  referenced by six documents and executed by zero workflows. It now runs in
  the required `mcp-doc-contract` job, with a reachability guard that fails if
  the step is removed *or* disarmed.

### Changed

- **Shared-daemon MCP wiring now separates native clients from bridges.**
  Codex 0.113+ is configured directly with `codex mcp add velesdb-memory
  --url …`, so its native Streamable HTTP client can re-initialize after an
  idle-session `404`; older or unrecognized versions are skipped without
  mutating their configuration, and the installer no longer removes an entry
  before attempting the add. Claude Desktop still requires a stdio bridge:
  both installers now ignore unversioned global copies and write the
  version-pinned `npx -y mcp-remote@0.1.38 <url> --transport http-only`
  command. They require Node.js 20.18.1 or newer for the bridge's current
  dependency tree, preserve strict trust through `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS`, and
  refuse the unsafe `NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0` escape hatch. The Desktop
  bridge's remaining limitation is explicit: it can still hang after its MCP
  session expires and must be restarted; `http-only` prevents transport
  fallback but does not fix that lifecycle bug. The daemon-side expiry
  regression now separately bounds the rejected POST to one second, proving a
  client timeout is not tool latency.

- **Cross-session resumption belongs to the `velesdb-memory` skill.**
  `list_working_contexts`, `load_working_context` and `save_working_context`
  were documented in `velesdb-context-optimizer` — the *compression* skill —
  and not once in the memory one, so an agent loading the skill named after
  memory was never told a previous session could be read back.
  `list_working_contexts` was taught nowhere at all, which left a mistyped
  session id returning `found: false` and reading as "no previous work". The
  memory skill now walks `list → load → work → save`, ties an empty load to
  discovery, and warns that `other_sessions` is filled in on a *hit* too — the
  wrong session resumed is the failure that looks like success. The
  compression skill keeps an explicit handoff to it and no longer restates the
  `working` envelope. The `load_working_context` return-shape pins moved with
  the declaration rather than being dropped, and
  `crates/velesdb-memory/skill/**` joined the swept surfaces: the bundled npm
  copy was policed while the source it is generated from was not.

### Added

- **A third versioned agent skill, `velesdb-learning-loop`.** It ships in
  `skills/`, in the npm package and in `velesdb-skills.tar.gz`, and it is the
  discipline over the other two: recall before designing, check whether a fix
  is a *recurrence* before storing it, correct a wrong memory instead of adding
  one beside it, and treat writing to memory as a decision rather than a
  reflex. `sync-skills.py --bundle` now **generates** the npm-bundled copies
  from the same registry the installer uses, and the release archive's skill
  list is held against that registry by a test — it was the fifth hand-written
  copy of the list and the only one pinned against nothing.
- **`scripts/check-skill-private-references.py`** — a versioned skill may not
  point at something only the closed repository holds. A skill is loaded on
  machines that have the open core and nothing else, so such a passage is
  unactionable where it is read. Strict and required, with three executed
  refusal vectors.
- **A machine-local layer for installed skills.** `LOCAL.md` beside an
  installed `SKILL.md` is preserved across `--install` and never reported as
  drift. It used to be deleted by the atomic swap and flagged `unexpected` by
  the check — silently destroying the only copy of a file the design invites
  you to write.

- **`velesdb-memory`: an OpenAI-compatible backend for both inference roles
  (#1751).** `VELESDB_MEMORY_EMBEDDER=openai` and
  `VELESDB_MEMORY_EXTRACTOR=openai` reach oMLX, llama.cpp's server, LM Studio,
  vLLM or a hosted provider. The value names a **protocol, not a vendor** — a
  different server is a different URL, never a new backend name — and the two
  roles are configured independently, so embedding on a local Ollama while
  extracting on an OpenAI-compatible server is a supported combination.
  Tokens live in the environment only (`..._API_TOKEN`); no token means no
  `Authorization` header at all, and an `api_token` written into
  `velesdb-memory.toml` is refused at startup. The MCP daemon is the only
  surface that changes here — Python, Node and WASM keep their current
  enumeration, and their parity is a lot of its own. Full detail in
  `crates/velesdb-memory/CHANGELOG.md`.

### Changed

- **BREAKING (`velesdb-memory` 0.12.0, and the Node/Python/WASM bindings +
  TypeScript SDK that relay it)**: `load_working_context` /
  `loadWorkingContext` now returns the `{found, working, other_sessions}`
  envelope the MCP server has served since V2a-1, instead of the bare working
  context (or `null`/`None`). Read `.working` / `["working"]` for the previous
  value; replace a null check with a `found` check. The bare form could not
  express the difference between "nothing was ever saved" and "a typo in
  `session` missed a session that exists", so an agent resuming a run silently
  started over on top of work sitting right next to where it looked. Full
  rationale and the parity guard that now enforces return SHAPE (not just
  method names) in `crates/velesdb-memory/CHANGELOG.md`.

  **Read this before cutting the next workspace release.** Only the two 0.x
  packages are bumped here (`velesdb-memory`, `@wiscale/velesdb-memory-node`,
  both to 0.12.0). The break also reaches three packages on the **4.x** line —
  `velesdb` (PyPI), `@wiscale/velesdb-sdk` and `@wiscale/velesdb-wasm`, all
  currently 4.2.0 and all published — because they relay the same return
  value. So:

  1. **The next workspace release must be a MAJOR (5.0.0), not a minor.** The
     `0.12.0` in the heading above is the memory crate's version and says
     nothing about the 4.x line; taking it as the whole story would ship a
     breaking change as 4.3.0, and every consumer pinned `>=4.2,<5` would take
     it silently. `check-version-sync.py` cannot catch this — it compares
     version strings to each other and has no notion of a breaking change.
     Note that the workspace manifest currently carries 4.3.0 as its
     *working* version; that number must not ship — the release that
     carries these changes ships as 5.0.0.
  2. **Raise `sdks/typescript/package.json`'s `@wiscale/velesdb-wasm` floor to
     that release.** It sits at `^4.1.0`, which resolves to builds that still
     return the bare form; it cannot be raised in advance because the version
     that carries the envelope does not exist yet. Until then the SDK detects
     the skew at runtime and rejects with an actionable `ConnectionError`
     rather than handing back an object whose `found` is `undefined` — but
     that guard is a net, not a substitute for the floor.
  3. **Raise `integrations/langgraph/pyproject.toml`'s `velesdb>=3.12.0`
     floor** for the same reason and with the same constraint; the toolkit
     likewise reports the drift at call time in the meantime.

## [4.2.0] — 2026-07-29

*This section was reconstructed after the fact from the merge history — the
50 first-parent commits between the 4.1.0 release commit and the 4.2.0
workspace bump (2026-07-26 → 2026-07-29); it was missing from this file when
4.2.0 shipped.*

Minor: the headline is `incoming_relations`. The engine already knew how to
read a node's incoming edges, but none of the three agent memories exposed
them, so a relation was only consultable from its emitter. This release
closes that, and brings the Node, Python and WASM bindings to parity with
the MCP tool surface.

### Added

- **`velesdb-core`**: `incoming_relations` on the three agent memories
  (semantic, episodic, procedural) — the exact mirror of `relations`,
  exposing a node's incoming edges. The one subtlety that matters: the
  queried point is alive by construction, so the TTL filter must keep the
  *far* endpoint (`source`) — an edge coming from an expired point is dead
  and must not be reported. (#1676)
- **Binding parity with the MCP tool surface, and the guard that keeps it
  permanent (#1668).** `entity` is now exposed on Node, Python and WASM —
  entity hubs are deliberately invisible to `recall`, so everything the
  autograph merged onto a hub was stored correctly yet unreachable from the
  three bindings. The same guard surfaced the other gaps it closed:
  `suggest_budget` on Node and Python, `list_working_contexts` and
  `compile_transcript` on Python. The pure-Rust half of the transcript
  bridge, previously two hand-synced copies in the Node and WASM bindings,
  now lives in `velesdb_memory::context::transcript_bridge`. The parity test
  holds every (tool, binding) pair to "implemented OR exempted with its
  reason", reading the binding surfaces from their sources rather than a
  manifest.
- **`velesdb-memory`**: `unrelate` — the symmetric cancellation of `relate`
  — plus a CI guard that proves the crate is publishable against the
  crates.io core before a release, and that learned to distinguish a
  transient bump-in-progress resolution failure from a genuinely missing
  core API. (#1666, #1678)
- **`velesdb-memory`**: the autograph builds the graph on its own and the
  daemon is configurable from a single file (#1627); extraction also orients
  the genitive, the plural and alliance phrasings (#1674) and kinship stated
  in the possessive (#1656); the autograph's predicate is bounded and the
  edge required (#1635).
- **`velesdb-memory`**: the daemon drains in-flight work on SIGTERM, not
  only on Ctrl-C — SIGTERM being what a service manager actually sends.
  (#1636)

### Fixed

- **MCP schema honesty**: every tool declares a typed *output* schema
  (#1611, #1617), optional slots in the advertised schemas are typed
  (#1655), the documented `pool` ceiling matches the code (#1675),
  `recall_fused` exposes its `pool` knob on the MCP tool (#1672), and the
  tools refuse the five malformed inputs they previously accepted (#1657).
- **`velesdb-memory` TTL races**: metadata and TTL are written in a single
  call (#1641), and the remaining race was closed without a new core API
  and shipped as 0.11.4 (#1650).
- **`velesdb-memory`**: `forget` collects the entity hubs that no fact
  mentions anymore (#1634); the config file is looked up next to the
  *effective* store path, not the default one (#1633); the text embedded
  from sources is capped and an overlong extracted fact is no longer fatal
  (#1664).
- **Feature flags**: `--features extract` (#1610) and `--features http`
  (#1617) each compile on their own.
- **Release pipeline**: `langgraph-velesdb` was absent from the PyPI matrix
  and is published again (#1616), and the 97 Rust tests of `velesdb-python`
  are executable again (#1670).

### Changed

- **`velesdb-memory`**: the JSON-schema `$defs` that inlining had made
  unreachable are pruned from the advertised schemas (#1612); six functions
  brought back under the complexity threshold (#1673); internal dedup in
  core of the secondary-index type, traversal metrics and score-context
  construction (#1648).

### Documentation

- A migration guide for 4.0.0 — the major had shipped without one (#1630); a
  four-wave documentation overhaul settling eight standing arbitrations
  (#1593); the declared MSRV now tells the truth, with a guard that stops
  Dependabot from re-proposing what breaks it (#1640); real names in the
  examples replaced by fictional ones (#1658); the TODO-tag rule described
  as CI actually enforces it (#1618).

### Maintenance

- `velesdb-memory` advanced from 0.11.3 to 0.11.5 inside this window (its
  own changelog has the detail); test determinism and coverage work landed
  (#1631, #1632, #1637, #1645, #1669, #1677); plus the usual batch of
  Dependabot updates (cargo, npm, GitHub Actions), the post-4.1.0 backmerge
  and the removal of two accidentally tracked local artifacts.

## [4.1.0] — 2026-07-26

Minor: 38 commits since 4.0.0. The CORE-2 governance lock now covers the REST
graph reads, the capability audit honours denials, and velesdb-memory fixes
four defects observed in real-world use.

### Fixed

- **`velesdb-core`**: the allocation backstop (#899) is no longer disturbed by
  concurrent index loads. `with_min_alloc_byte_limit` — used by the persisted
  HNSW load path to admit a file-backed vector payload — raised the
  *process-global* ceiling for the duration of the load, which had two
  consequences: while any load was in flight the backstop was effectively lifted
  for every other thread, and two overlapping loads clobbered each other's saved
  ceiling (the inner scope saved the outer scope's temporary value and
  republished it on exit), leaving the process-wide ceiling permanently wrong
  after both loads had finished. Scoped adjustments are now thread-local via the
  new `alloc_guard::with_alloc_byte_limit`, so a ceiling installed for one
  operation is invisible to unrelated threads and overlapping scopes nest
  correctly. `set_alloc_byte_limit` is unchanged: it remains the process-wide
  operator policy and still bounds allocations on worker threads.
- **`velesdb-memory`**: the Ollama embedder issued its HTTP request through a
  bare `ureq::post` with **no timeout at all**, so an Ollama that accepted the
  connection and never answered (a stalled cold model load, a wedged server)
  blocked the caller indefinitely. Because `remember` / `save_working_context`
  embed *before* writing, that surfaced as an opaque MCP transport timeout on
  the client with nothing in the server's own error path — observed live as
  `MCP error -32001: Request timed out`. Requests now go through a
  `ureq::Agent` bounded at 60 s, the same pattern `extract.rs` has used for its
  own Ollama calls since it was written. Proven by a test that stands up a
  socket which accepts and never replies: 30.0 s before, bounded after.
- **`velesdb-server`**: eight plain REST graph read endpoints — `get_edges`,
  `traverse_graph`, `get_node_degree`, `get_edge_count`, `list_nodes`,
  `get_node_edges`, `get_node_payload` and `traverse_parallel` — resolved their
  collection through `graph_preamble()`, which recorded a metric and looked the
  collection up but **never consulted `Database::authorize_read()`**. Every
  sibling read path (VelesQL `MATCH`, `/graph/search`, `/search*`) already routed
  through that gate, so a registered observer could deny a principal on all of
  them while these eight still returned nodes, edges and payloads unfiltered.
  They now go through `graph_read_preamble()`, which fails closed with `403` on a
  `Deny` **and** on a scope-narrowing decision, since a graph read has no
  metadata-filter channel to apply a narrowed scope to — the same choice already
  made by `MATCH` and `/graph/search`. Write endpoints are untouched:
  `authorize_read` is a read-only gate. With no observer registered (the default
  single-tenant deployment) this is unobservable, `authorize_read` being a single
  `Option` check returning `Ok(None)`. Note for operators running a
  scope-narrowing observer: such a read previously returned data **unfiltered**
  and now returns `403`.

### Added

- **`velesdb-core`**: `alloc_guard::with_alloc_byte_limit(limit, f)` — runs `f`
  with the per-allocation ceiling pinned on the current thread only, restoring
  the previous value on exit (including on panic). Scoped counterpart to
  `set_alloc_byte_limit` for hardening or relaxing a single operation.
- **`velesdb-memory`**: `velesdb-memory compile-stdin --budget N [--query …]`
  — compile text read on stdin with the deterministic context compiler and
  print `{content, tokens_in, tokens_out, tokens_saved, risk}` as JSON. It
  short-circuits in `main` *before* the store is opened, exactly like
  `--version`, so it takes no `flock` and can run in a second process while
  a session's own MCP server holds the store. A budget too small to fit any
  fragment is a hard error rather than an empty success: an empty
  compilation is worse than none for a caller that substitutes the result.
- **agent-hooks**: a fourth Claude Code hook, `PostToolUse`
  (`integrations/agent-hooks/claude-code/hooks/post-tool-use.sh`). It is the
  only hook whose output can *replace* what the model sees
  (`hookSpecificOutput.updatedToolOutput`), so it compresses oversized tool
  results before they enter the transcript — where the other three hooks can
  only nudge the model to call a tool itself. Allowlisted tools only
  (`Bash,Grep,WebFetch` by default; `Read`/`Edit` are excluded by design),
  above a size threshold, with the untouched original archived and its path
  quoted in the replacement, a pure-bash watchdog (`timeout` is absent from
  a stock macOS) bounding the call, and an identity fallback on every
  failure path — including a `velesdb-memory` too old to know the
  subcommand, which would otherwise treat the piped stdin as MCP traffic.


## [4.0.0] — 2026-07-24

### Security

- **`velesdb-memory`**: metadata is now size-capped. Caller-supplied
  `metadata` on `remember`/`remember_with_ttl` and per-fragment metadata in
  the context compiler were unbounded, letting an arbitrarily large JSON
  blob be persisted as a DoS vector. Added `MAX_METADATA_BYTES` (64 KiB)
  and a typed `MemoryError::MetadataTooLarge`, enforced across every
  adapter (MCP, Python, Node, WASM). `save_working_context` is now capped
  at the existing 1 MiB `MAX_FACT_BYTES` ceiling, and
  `load_working_context` now verifies the reserved system marker before
  returning a stored context, so a slot squatted by an unrelated fact
  yields `None` instead of being served back. (#1458)

### Changed

- **`velesdb-core` / `velesdb-wasm`**: single-sourced the fusion math that
  had drifted across engines (parity-audit finding, issue #1545).
  `velesdb-core::fusion::min_max_normalize` is now `pub`, and
  `velesdb-wasm`'s `relative_score`/`rsf` per-branch normalization delegates
  to it instead of maintaining its own copy of the same min-max math. Core
  also now exposes canonical `DEFAULT_WEIGHTED_AVG_WEIGHT` /
  `DEFAULT_WEIGHTED_MAX_WEIGHT` / `DEFAULT_WEIGHTED_HIT_WEIGHT` constants
  (`0.6` / `0.3` / `0.1`, matching the Python bindings and the
  `velesdb_common` fusion builder) and a `FusionStrategy::weighted_default()`
  constructor. **Behavior change, `velesdb-wasm` only:**
  `multi_query_search(..., strategy: "weighted")` previously hardcoded a
  non-overridable `avg=0.5, max=0.3, hit=0.2` split; it now defaults to the
  canonical `0.6/0.3/0.1` weights and accepts an optional `weights`
  parameter to override them per call. This reorders `weighted`-fusion
  results for existing WASM callers that didn't request explicit weights.
  See `crates/velesdb-wasm/CHANGELOG.md` for the full migration note.

### Added

- **`VelesConfig` on every remaining surface (issue #1549)** — after the
  server/CLI wiring (#1565), the four surfaces that could still only open
  the engine on core defaults now accept an explicit engine configuration,
  all built on the same engine-only TOML loaders
  (`load_from_path_engine_only` / `from_toml_engine_only`) with fail-fast
  validation and the typed `ConfigError` preserved:
  - **`tauri-plugin-velesdb`**: new plugin `Builder` with
    `with_config(VelesConfig)` / `with_config_path(path)` (fail-fast at
    build time), threading through the four observer×config open
    combinations; `VelesConfig` re-exported for hosts; typed
    `Error::ConfigLoad` variant.
  - **`velesdb-mobile`**: `open_with_config(_toml)` and
    `open_with_observer_and_config(_toml)` UniFFI constructors (TOML file
    path or embedded TOML string — the string variant suits mobile asset
    pipelines); `ConfigError` surfaced through the flat UniFFI error as
    `VELES-009` with the full message.
  - **`velesdb-python`**: `VelesConfigOptions` now covers the full engine
    surface — new `SearchConfigOptions`, `HnswConfigOptions`,
    `StorageOptions` and `QuantizationOptions` sections alongside the
    existing `limits`, plus `VelesConfigOptions.from_toml(str)` /
    `from_toml_path(path)`. Invalid values raise at construction or at
    `Database(path, config=...)` open, never silently. `wal_batch` stays
    intentionally unexposed (velesdb-premium Enterprise feature). Stubs,
    pure-python adapter and README updated.
  - **`langchain-velesdb` / `llamaindex-velesdb`**: every store/memory
    entry point that creates a `Database` accepts an optional
    `config: velesdb.VelesConfigOptions` pass-through (vector stores,
    chat/semantic/episodic/procedural memories, native `GraphLoader`),
    and the shared `velesdb_common.graph.open_native_graph` helper
    forwards it too. Omitting `config` is bit-for-bit the previous
    behaviour.
- **`velesdb-cli`**: new `graph doctor <collection> [--purge|--stub]`
  subcommand to audit and repair legacy phantom edges -- edges present in
  a graph collection's edge store whose `source` or `target` node has no
  stored payload. These can only exist in a database created before the
  #1442 referential-integrity fix; WAL/snapshot replay at `Collection::open`
  intentionally never re-validates edges, since filtering them there could
  silently drop data for legitimate edge-only graphs. `doctor` is
  read-only by default (reports the phantom count with no mutation);
  `--purge` removes phantom edges via the existing crash-durable
  `remove_edge` path, `--stub` seeds a minimal `{}` payload for each
  missing endpoint instead. Both flags are mutually exclusive and
  idempotent. (#1469)
- **`velesdb-memory` (Python)**: `MemoryService.feedback` is now exposed,
  closing the RL feedback loop from the Python binding. (#1452)
- **`velesdb-wasm`**: `compileTranscript`, `explainCompilation`,
  `contextSavings`, and `suggestBudget` are now exposed on the browser
  `MemoryService` (previously Node/MCP-only), closing most of the
  context-compiler tool-surface gap in WASM. `feedback` stays
  intentionally absent — it lives behind `velesdb-memory`'s
  `persistence` feature, which the WASM build does not enable (a durable
  learned confidence is meaningless for a store that disappears on page
  reload). `rememberExtracted` also stays absent (needs a generative
  model, which would pull a network dependency into the WASM bundle by
  default). (#1547)
- **`velesdb-node`**: `compileTranscript` and `listWorkingContexts` are
  now exposed, closing the Node-side gap for both (`compileTranscript`
  was MCP-only; `listWorkingContexts` had `save`/`load` but not `list`).
  `index.d.ts` regenerated. (#1547)
- **`@wiscale/velesdb-sdk`**: the browser `MemoryService` gains
  `compileTranscript`, `explainCompilation`, `contextSavings`, and
  `suggestBudget`, delegating to the new WASM exports above.
  `MemoryMetadata._veles_date` is now a typed, documented field (was
  untyped `Record<string, unknown>`), and `recallFusedDated`'s TSDoc now
  explains the zero-setup `"_veles_date"` pairing. (#1547)
- **`velesdb_common`**: `stable_hash_id` gains an opt-in
  `algorithm="fnv1a"` keyword parameter (default stays `"sha256"`,
  unchanged) so a Python-derived point ID can agree byte-for-byte with
  `velesdb_core::hash_id`/`velesdb-migrate`'s FNV-1a derivation for the same
  string when interop across ingestion paths is needed. Separately,
  `velesdb-core` now exports a public `hash_id_bytes`, and
  `velesdb-memory`/`velesdb-migrate` delegate their own FNV-1a derivations to
  it instead of each re-declaring the FNV-1a constants — a pure internal
  dedup within the Rust crates, byte-identical output (see the golden-vector
  regression tests added alongside); it does not by itself change the
  Rust-vs-Python divergence, which the new opt-in addresses. See
  `docs/reference/KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md` #12 for the full contract, including
  why the SHA-256 default is intentionally preserved. (#1542)

### Fixed

- **`velesdb-memory` (MCP)**: tool parameters are now harness-proof on both
  wire directions. Real MCP client harnesses were observed serializing
  non-string arguments as JSON-encoded strings once their view of the
  advertised schema degraded — `save_working_context`'s `working` object
  arrived as `"{\"goal\": ...}"` and the call failed with `invalid type:
  string, expected struct WorkingContext`, silently losing session
  handoffs; `recall_fused` rejected `limit: "6"` and stringified `filter`
  objects the same way. Two-sided fix, same defensive-interop class as the
  #1468 string-id contract: (1) `$ref`-only top-level parameter schemas are
  now inlined so every parameter advertises a direct `type` keyword
  (`working` exposes `type: object`); (2) a lenient deserializer on every
  non-string tool parameter accepts the properly-typed value first and
  falls back to parsing a JSON-encoded string, with a precise error when
  neither form fits.
- **`velesdb-wasm`**: the VelesQL JOIN executor no longer depends on which
  side of the `ON` condition names the joined table. `ON joined.col =
  base.col` used to match nothing (NULL joined columns on every row);
  `equality_keys` now orients the condition like core's
  `normalize_join_condition`. Conformance join case J005 locks both engines
  (was executor-conformance divergence D002). (issue #1555)
- **`velesdb-core`**: `Database::execute_aggregate` now applies the
  statement's `OFFSET`/`LIMIT` to GROUP BY results after ORDER BY, matching
  the WASM aggregate pipeline (executor-conformance divergence D006). As in
  WASM, there is no default cap: a LIMIT-less GROUP BY still returns every
  group. Conformance fixture gains case G005 locking the behaviour on both
  engines. (issue #1556)
- **`scripts/check-promise-contract.py`**: the promise-contract guardrail
  only ever checked that a claim's `must_contain` substring was still
  present in the file it points at — it never executed
  `validation_command`, so the contract could guarantee a number wasn't
  *lost* from a doc without ever proving it was still *true*. Two real
  drifts (a stale WASM bundle-size figure off by +25-28%, and a benchmark
  corpus label reading 5K when the bench actually inserts 10K vectors)
  slipped through and were only caught by a manual re-verification pass.
  Claims in `docs/reference/promise-contract.json` now carry an explicit
  `"executable"` flag: claims whose `validation_command` is a fast,
  deterministic, local, no-network README-vs-committed-file comparison
  (`grep`/file-content checks) are marked `true` and are now actually run
  via subprocess, failing the script on a real mismatch; claims needing a
  costly measurement (`cargo bench`, a release build, a published-package
  download) stay `false` — documentary only — and are explicitly skipped
  with a visible message naming the claim and the unverified command,
  never silently ignored. 6 of 27 claims are now executed for real; 21
  remain documentary. (issue #1518)
- **`velesdb-memory`**: two `compile_transcript`/`segment_transcript`
  adversarial-review follow-ups from #1500, deliberately deferred (issue
  #1516). **(1) Error taxonomy — potentially breaking for a caller
  matching on the error variant/message.** A forced
  `segmentation.format: "jsonl"` that failed to parse used to surface as
  `MemoryError::ContextOverLimit` with a misleading "over limit" prefix on
  what is really a format/parsing failure, not a budget breach. It now
  surfaces as a new, dedicated `MemoryError::SegmentationError` variant.
  Both stay in the same `INVALID_PARAMS`-category MCP taxonomy (JSON-RPC
  code unchanged), so an MCP client only sees the error message change;
  a Rust caller of `velesdb-memory` directly that pattern-matched on
  `MemoryError::ContextOverLimit` for this specific case must now match
  `MemoryError::SegmentationError` instead. A genuine budget/cap breach
  (transcript over the byte cap, an unsplittable oversized fence, too many
  fragments after merging) is unaffected — still `ContextOverLimit`. **(2)
  Duplicated ranges.** Re-splitting a `content_override` (a `jsonl` line
  whose decoded `content` alone exceeded `MAX_FRAGMENT_BYTES`, over 1 MiB)
  used to give every resulting child segment the SAME original line's byte
  range, so `segmentation.segments` reported overlapping ranges —
  contradicting the partition property `compile_transcript` advertises.
  Each child now gets a distinct, non-overlapping sub-range of the
  original line, proportional to its share of the decoded content (a
  JSONL line's raw JSON-escaped bytes have no byte-exact mapping back to
  the decoded text, so the split is proportional, not byte-precise) —
  `segmentation.segments` now partitions the transcript exactly in every
  case, including this one.
- **`velesdb-memory`**: the `compile_context` prompt-cache prefix could
  churn when only the query changed. `selection_order`
  (`src/context/budget.rs`) used lexical relevance to the query as a
  packing tie-break for every fragment, including `cache: true` ones — so
  when a budget was too tight to fit two same-priority cache-marked
  fragments, a query change alone could flip which one won, silently
  changing the byte content of the Cache section and defeating provider
  prompt-caching on exactly the turn a new question was asked. A
  cache-marked fragment's rank now never consults relevance, in either
  direction: it always outranks a non-cache fragment of the same
  criticality/priority (a fixed, query-independent tier), and two
  cache-marked fragments tied on priority fall straight to `seq`.
  **Trade-off, assumed:** cache stability over relevance, for cache-marked
  fragments only — a more-relevant non-cache fragment can now lose a
  tight-budget race it would have won before this fix against a same-tier
  cache fragment. Non-cache fragments are unaffected. (issue #1455)
- **`velesdb-memory`**: a permanent `ctx://source/` handle could expire
  silently — a source first written under a TTL was never promoted when a
  later compile asked for permanent storage. Storage now applies a
  never-downgrade rule: permanent always wins over an existing TTL, and a
  TTL never downgrades an existing permanent slot. (#1454)
- **`velesdb-memory`**: two byte-identical screenshots of the same
  supersession target could both drop from compiled context instead of one
  surviving. Media dedup now re-anchors onto the freshest non-superseded
  occurrence. (#1453)
- **`velesdb-core` / `velesdb-server`**: `add_edge` and `add_edges_batch`
  now reject an edge whose `source` or `target` node has no stored payload
  (#1442), instead of silently accepting it. Previously, on schemaless
  graph collections (the default), an edge could reference a node ID that
  was never explicitly created — the edge was stored, but the node stayed
  invisible to `GET /graph/nodes`, `all_node_ids()`, and `MATCH`, since all
  three resolve their node set from the payload store, not the edge store.
  The REST layer now returns `404 NodeNotFound` (`VELES-022`) for such an
  edge, matching the existing strict-schema behavior and the
  `velesdb-memory` wedge's `relate()`, which already required both
  endpoints to exist. **Migration note:** code that called `addEdge`/
  `INSERT EDGE` without first creating the endpoint nodes (via a point
  upsert or `PUT /graph/nodes/{id}/payload`) must now create them first —
  see `docs/guides/GRAPH_PATTERNS.md`. Follow-on fixes found in review:
  `POST /collections/{name}/relations` (the point-relations REST endpoint)
  previously mapped this same error to a generic `500`; it now returns
  `404`/`VELES-022` like every other graph endpoint. `velesdb-memory`'s
  `relate()` previously downgraded the identical concurrent-delete race to
  a generic internal error instead of its documented `NotFound` contract;
  fixed. `velesdb-migrate`'s FK-relations phase writes into a fresh,
  edge-only graph collection that never otherwise gets node payloads —
  it now stubs each edge endpoint before inserting, and a batch-level
  validation failure degrades to per-edge accounting instead of aborting
  the whole migration.
- **`velesdb-core`**: closed a race left by the #1442 fix above —
  `add_edge`/`add_edges_batch` used to release the payload-store guard
  right after checking that both endpoints exist, then separately acquire
  the edge-WAL lock to write the edge. A concurrent `delete()` of an
  endpoint could land in that window and still leave a "phantom" edge
  (present in the edge store, invisible to `all_node_ids()`/MATCH). Both
  entry points now hold the payload-store read guard from the check
  through the end of the write, so a racing `delete()` blocks until the
  edge is durable instead of running ahead; see the "Collection-level lock
  order" section of `docs/CONCURRENCY_MODEL.md` for the full mechanism.
  Also fixed: `velesdb-migrate`'s FK-relations node-seeding marked a node
  as seeded even when its stub upsert failed, permanently skipping any
  retry for that node later in the same relation — it now only marks a
  node seeded on a successful upsert. **Known, accepted limitation**:
  edges loaded from a pre-existing WAL/snapshot (replay) are not
  re-validated, so a database created before the original #1442 fix may
  still contain legacy phantom edges; tracked in
  [#1469](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/issues/1469) (a
  `velesdb-cli graph doctor` audit/repair subcommand). The
  strict-vs-schemaless error-type divergence (`SchemaValidation` vs.
  `NodeNotFound`) noted above remains deliberate; unifying it is tracked
  for the next major version in
  [#1470](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/issues/1470).

- **`velesdb-memory`**: hardened the MCP server against a leaked client
  process (#1448). The server itself was already healthy (it exits cleanly
  on stdin EOF), but a client that leaks its child process — observed in
  practice with a headless `claude -p` run — never closes stdin, so the
  server correctly kept serving forever and held the store's single-writer
  lock, making every later session fail with an opaque `Storage
  (DatabaseLocked)` / "Failed to connect". Two defensive fixes: (1) the
  server now detects a dead parent (`std::os::unix::process::parent_id()`
  polled every ~2s, Unix-only, no new dependency) and self-exits, releasing
  the lock, even when stdin is artificially held open; (2) a `DatabaseLocked`
  at startup now retries briefly (3 × 500ms, covering a normal
  close/reopen handover) and, if the store is still locked, prints an
  actionable message on stderr naming the fix (`pkill velesdb-memory` or
  set `VELESDB_MEMORY_PATH` elsewhere) instead of a bare error dump — and
  exits non-zero so client health-checks can detect the failure. Net
  effect: one leaked client can no longer brick every later session, and
  when a store really is locked, the user is told what to do about it.

### Documentation

- **Clarified**: images are never resized; oversized media is externalized
  with a retrieval handle (`ctx://source/<hash>`), not downscaled.
- **`velesdb-memory`**: per-surface parity for the context compiler is now
  stated honestly (MCP/Rust full, Node minus `context_savings`/
  `explain_compilation`, Python merged on `develop` but not yet in the
  published wheel, WASM `compileContext` only); fixed
  `retrieve_context_source`'s documented Python return type (`str` ->
  `dict`); documented a known limitation that the compiled-context cache
  prefix is byte-stable only while the compile `query` stays the same —
  under a tight budget, a query change can reorder competing cache-marked
  fragments (issue #1455). (#1459)

### Changed

- **CI**: `examples/**` changes now trigger CI, a test guards the
  generated Node `index.d.ts` against stale hand edits, and four
  previously-unpinned context-compiler behaviors are now covered by
  regression tests. (#1456)

### Added — deterministic context compiler (EPIC-P-070 base feature; shipped as `velesdb-memory` 0.8.0 / `velesdb-node` 0.8.0 via the `velesdb-memory-v0.8.0` tag — the EPIC-P-071 follow-ups further down in this section ship separately, see the note below)

- **`velesdb-memory`**: new default `context` feature — a deterministic
  context compiler (no LLM, no network, no clock; same request ⇒
  byte-identical output). Pipeline `chunk → classify → dedup → score → pack →
  assemble`: duplicates drop, repeated log lines collapse with counts,
  code/URLs/numbers/negative constraints survive verbatim, over-budget
  content becomes recoverable `ctx://source/<hash>` handles, every fragment
  gets one auditable decision (stable rule id, reason, relevance, risk).
  First text chunker in the workspace (UTF-8-safe, code-fence-atomic), the
  first shipped `Reranker` implementation (`DeterministicReranker`), a
  `TokenEstimator` seam, injectable versioned `PricingTable` (u64
  micro-units, never hardcoded), and a memory bridge
  (`compile_context`/`retrieve_context_source`/`context_savings`/
  `save_working_context`) whose stored system facts are invisible to normal
  recall.
- **MCP**: four new tools on the one existing server (`compile_context`,
  `context_savings`, `explain_compilation`, `retrieve_context_source`) —
  domain types are the wire types, no DTO duplication.
- **Node** (`@wiscale/velesdb-memory-node`): `compileContext(request)` —
  pure conversion, ids as decimal strings; ships the
  `velesdb-context-optimizer` agent skill in the npm package.
> **From here on, this section is EPIC-P-071.** Unless a bullet says
> otherwise, these items ship as `velesdb-memory` / `velesdb-node` 0.9.0
> via the `velesdb-memory-v0.9.0` tag. The Python bullet immediately below
> is the one exception.

- **Python** (`velesdb`): context-compiler parity on `MemoryService` —
  `compile_context` / `retrieve_context_source` / `context_savings` /
  `save_working_context` / `load_working_context`, same wire shapes as the
  MCP tools; ids cross as exact native Python ints (vs decimal strings on
  Node). Ships with the **next workspace release** (the `velesdb` PyPI
  package's own version line), not with the `velesdb-memory-v0.9.0` tag —
  the published `velesdb` 3.12.0 wheel does not include `compile_context`
  yet. [EPIC-P-071/US-001]
- **`velesdb-memory`**: usage-driven importance blend in `context_memories`
  — `CompilePolicy.importance` (`{confidence: 0.2, recency: 0.1,
  recency_field: null}`, serde-defaulted so 0.8.0 requests stay
  wire-compatible) folds the RL confidence `feedback` trains and a
  batch-relative recency term into the fused ranking of pulled memories:
  `fused_norm + w_c·(confidence−0.5)·2 + w_r·recency_norm`. Applies only to
  the similarity-selected pool (confidence is not relevance — an adversarial
  test pins that an over-reinforced off-topic fact never enters), reads no
  clock (recency is min-max normalised within the batch; an absent key or a
  degenerate batch contributes 0), composes with the
  `compile_context_reranked` seam, and ventilates all four signals in each
  decision's `reason` (`vector …, graph …, confidence …, recency …`). Both
  weights at 0 reproduce the 0.8.0 output byte for byte (golden-pinned).
  **Behavioral change**: with the default policy the blend is active
  (`confidence: 0.2`), so RL-reinforced memories now rank higher out of the
  box after an upgrade; set the importance weights to 0 to restore the exact
  0.8.0 ordering (byte-identical, golden-tested). Recommended weight range
  is `[0, 1]`; out-of-range values are accepted verbatim, never clamped
  (documented and regression-tested). [EPIC-P-071/US-002]
- **Node** (`@wiscale/velesdb-memory-node`): `feedback(id, success)` binding
  (resolves to the fact's new learned confidence), and a committed RL×graph
  synergy case in the `tri_engine_rescue` benchmark: a fact reinforced by
  `feedback` and reachable only through the typed-edge walk out-ranks a
  merely-similar fact once `policy.importance` is active — reproducible
  across runs. [EPIC-P-071/US-002]
- **Benchmark**: `examples/context_savings`, reproducible (75–82 % estimated
  token savings on the committed corpus in ~2 ms; figures are local
  estimates, not billed tokens — cross-checked against a real cl100k
  tokenizer by the committed `real_measures/` scripts).
- **MCP**: two working-context tools on the one existing server —
  `save_working_context` / `load_working_context` (pure delegation to the
  memory bridge), so an agent can persist its distilled session state and a
  later session can resume from it; the committed `mcp_e2e.py` harness
  proves the round-trip **across two separate server processes** on one
  store. [EPIC-P-071/US-003]
- **Node** (`@wiscale/velesdb-memory-node`): `saveWorkingContext` /
  `loadWorkingContext` — same wire shape, ids as decimal strings in both
  directions (u64::MAX-safe), `null` when nothing was saved; the spec suite
  proves the cross-process round-trip via a child-process save.
  [EPIC-P-071/US-003]
- **WASM** (`@wiscale/velesdb-wasm`) + **TypeScript SDK**
  (`@wiscale/velesdb-sdk`): `compileContext(request)` — the same
  deterministic compiler, compiled to wasm, running fully in the browser
  (`velesdb-memory`'s zero-dependency `context` feature enabled on the wasm
  build). Ids cross as decimal strings; in-memory semantics documented
  (`ctx://source/` handles and savings events live for the browser session —
  no persistence in WASM). [EPIC-P-071/US-004]
- Internal, non-breaking: `fusion::fuse` re-expressed over `fuse_scored`
  (identical candidates/order/numbers, iso-behavior pinned by test);
  intra-doc links fixed so `RUSTDOCFLAGS="-D warnings" cargo doc` passes.
- Internal, non-breaking: the `context` id wire contract (`ID_KEYS`,
  decimal-string ⇄ `u64` tree rewrite) moved from two copy-pasted
  implementations (Node's `convert.rs`, WASM's `memory_service.rs`) to one
  shared `velesdb_memory::context::wire` module both bindings now delegate
  to — same behavior (pinned by the moved logic's own new unit tests plus
  the existing Node/WASM suites), one source of truth for future `context`
  id fields instead of two to keep in sync.
- **`velesdb-memory`**: `CompilePolicy.normalize_log_timestamps` (default
  `false`, serde-defaulted so existing requests stay wire-compatible) — an
  opt-in, deterministic mask of `kind: "log"` fragments' volatile prefixes
  (ISO/syslog timestamps, bracketed hex/pid counters, fixed patterns only)
  applied before `abstract.log_dedup` groups repeated lines, so lines
  identical modulo timestamp now collapse; the emitted line is still the
  first occurrence's exact bytes, and the decision `reason` says so when
  normalization actually changed the grouping. Off by default: byte-exact
  grouping is unchanged for existing callers (pinned by a golden test).
  [EPIC-P-071/US-006]
- Doc-only: crate README sections on injecting a model-exact
  `TokenEstimator` per provider (`examples/context_savings/real_measures/exact_estimator.mjs`
  reproduces the `HeuristicEstimator` calibration margins on fresh corpus
  snippets — always a safe over-count, +9.6 % to +63.8 % measured), the
  `MAX_TOKEN_BUDGET` dry-run audit pattern (sort `decisions` by `relevance`
  client-side, nothing is lost), and `source_ttl_seconds`'s permanent-by-
  default trade-off with a manual-purge "disk growth" section.
  [EPIC-P-071/US-005, US-006]
- **Proof harness**: `examples/context_savings/real_measures/cache_prefix.mjs`
  measures the `cache: true` section's byte-stable-prefix percentage across
  10 consecutive compiles with changing volatile content (100 % stable
  prefix on all 9 consecutive turn pairs, reproducible) and frames the
  naive full-input-rate cost of not caching it against an injected,
  never-hardcoded `policy.pricing` table. [EPIC-P-071/US-008]
- **Proof harness**: `examples/node-llm-middleware/` — a minimal
  middleware wrapper measuring `compile_context` savings offline (real
  cl100k via `gpt-tokenizer`, always) and, opt-in
  (`RUN_BILLED_MEASURE=1` + an API key never asked for by the harness), the
  provider's own billed `usage` on a real minimal-cost call.
  [EPIC-P-071/US-007]
- **MCP**: `CompilePolicy.ids_as_strings` (default `false`) — opts the
  `compile_context` / `explain_compilation` response into decimal-string ids
  (`fragment_id`, `content_hash`, `memory_id`, `fragment_ids`), reusing the
  same tree walk the Node/WASM bindings already apply, for raw MCP clients
  without u64-safe JSON number parsing. `fragments[].id` on input now also
  accepts either a JSON number or a decimal string, and the advertised tool
  schemas type every such field `["integer", "string"]` so schema-validating
  clients accept the opt-in form. [EPIC-P-071]
- **MCP**: `explain_compilation` gains an optional `fragment_index` (0-based
  position in `request.fragments`), so byte-identical fragments — which
  share a content-addressed `fragment_id` — can be disambiguated instead of
  always resolving to the deduplication survivor's decision. Default
  behavior (no `fragment_index`) is unchanged. [EPIC-P-071]
- **Release**: every GitHub Release now attaches `velesdb-skills.tar.gz`
  (the `velesdb-memory` and `velesdb-context-optimizer` agent skills, one
  folder per skill at the archive root) — `curl -L … | tar -xz -C
  ~/.claude/skills/` installs both without cloning the repo. [EPIC-P-071]
- **Media fragments now wired on every surface** (US-009, PR3 of 3 —
  PR1/PR2 shipped the compiler-side atomic packing, dedup, cost, screenshot
  supersession, and the MCP/Python bindings): the MCP `compile_context` /
  `retrieve_context_source` advertised JSON schemas now carry
  `fragments[].media` and the optional `media` on the retrieve result
  (pinned by structural schema tests, not just accepted-on-input); the Node
  binding (`@wiscale/velesdb-memory-node`) gains
  `retrieveContextSource(handle)` (`{handle, content, media?}`, same shape
  as the MCP tool) alongside `compileContext`'s existing media passthrough;
  WASM's `compileContext` compiles, dedups, and prices media fragments
  correctly on the in-memory `WasmStore` (`retrieveContextSource` is not
  yet exposed there — a deliberately separate follow-up, not required to
  prove media fragments compile on wasm); the TypeScript SDK's
  `CompileContextFragment` type gains `media?: {mime, bytes_b64}`. The
  `velesdb-context-optimizer` skill documents when to route a screenshot
  through `media` and how `metadata.target` drives supersession.
  [EPIC-P-071/US-009]
- **Benchmark**: `examples/real-session-benchmark/` — realistic agentic
  sessions (screenshots with US-009 dedup/supersession, CI logs for
  `normalize_log_timestamps`, re-injected docs, re-read code files) run A/B:
  raw ("vraie vie", everything resent every turn) vs compiled
  (`compileContext`; the compiled arm is billed for the `ctx://source/`
  handles it sends). OFFLINE (default; real cl100k tokenizer + the API's own
  pixels/750 image-token formula; every variant reproduced twice,
  byte-identical) measures, on the committed corpora: **17.2%** saved on the
  base 14-turn session in lossless mode (pure redundancy elimination, zero
  unique information removed — externalized: 0), **20.3%** in
  window-enforcement mode (budget 8000; the extra ~3 points explicitly
  attributed to `budget.externalize` of unique content, not redundancy),
  **30.9%** lossless / **55.1%** windowed on the 36-turn long-session
  variant (with per-arm context-growth curves and labeled projected headroom
  to a configurable compaction threshold: raw ~234 tokens/turn vs compiled
  ~35/turn), and **18.4%** on the memory-enabled variant (docs stored once
  via `remember`/`relate`, pulled back per turn via the default
  `memory_scope` — the product's intended pattern, untuned k=5). ONLINE
  (opt-in, `RUN_BILLED_MEASURE=1` + `CONFIRM_SPEND=1`) bills the same
  session for real on `claude-sonnet-5` — reading the provider's own
  `usage.input_tokens` with cache fields reported separately — AND grades
  real generated answers in both arms against committed per-turn fact
  checklists (deterministic substring grader): token savings and answer
  adequacy are reported side by side, so a saving that costs answers is a
  reported failure. Runners: native `fetch` (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`) or the
  Claude Code CLI's headless mode (`BENCH_RUNNER=cli`, no key — the user's
  own authenticated account; wire shapes verified by a real calibration
  call). [EPIC-P-071]
- **CI gate — ground-truth facts survive compilation** (EPIC-P-071/A1):
  `examples/real-session-benchmark/test/facts-survive.test.mjs` turns the
  benchmark's per-turn fact checklists (`corpus/questions.mjs`) into an
  executable non-regression check: for every turn of the base session, in
  BOTH the lossless and the window-8000 compiled arms, every ground-truth
  fact must be present in what that arm would actually send to the model —
  inline, or PROVEN recoverable by really resolving its `ctx://source/`
  handle via `retrieveContextSource` (never assumed from a listed handle).
  Runs offline, no network, in CI's `Node Binding Tests` job (reuses the
  napi addon already built there). [EPIC-P-071]

R1 `Collection`-internals train: resolves and **closes the god-object EPIC
([#1384](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/issues/1384))**. The
internals are organized to the maximum structurally sound point; full per-kind
exclusive decomposition was investigated and documented as structurally
infeasible (see the F2.2 entry in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for the complete
account).

> **Note for the next release**: this train contains a **breaking Rust core
> API change** (the `into_vector_facade` removal below). Per the declared
> SemVer policy, tag the next release accordingly — a major bump, or an
> explicitly documented exception in these release notes.

### Removed — BREAKING (Rust core API)

- **`AnyCollection::into_vector_facade` is removed** (R1.4). The facade —
  introduced in 3.11.0 as the safe replacement for `into_vector_unchecked` —
  coerced *any* variant into a `VectorCollection`, so the kind a caller
  captured could diverge from the collection's real kind. *Migration*: use the
  variant-checked `AnyCollection::into_vector()` (returns `Err(self)` on the
  wrong variant so ownership is recovered); bindings that deliberately need
  the **structural view** of a graph/metadata store behind the
  `VectorCollection` newtype (single user-facing `Collection` type, vector-only
  ops gated by a separately tracked kind) use
  `GraphCollection::into_vector_view()` /
  `MetadataCollection::into_vector_view()` instead.

### Changed

- **`Collection` internals regrouped into six named concern sub-structs**
  (R1.1 — internal-only, `pub(crate)`, non-breaking): `StorageState`,
  `GraphStore`, `QueryState`, `GenerationCounters`, `StreamingState`,
  `RuntimeGuards`, with the lock ordering preserved verbatim.
- **`order_by_advisor` reclassified out of the graph cluster into
  `QueryState`** (R1.2a — internal-only): it is a generic `ORDER BY` scan
  concern reached on any collection kind, not graph state.
- **Graph cluster held as a shared `Arc<GraphStore>` handle** (R1.2b —
  internal-only): graph state can be shared with `GraphCollection` without an
  exclusive move; field access and locking are unchanged.

- **`forget` now reports whether the id actually existed** on every surface
  (Rust bridge → `bool`, MCP `{found}`, Node/WASM/TS `boolean`,
  Python `bool`): deleting an unknown id used to read as success, so an
  agent could not tell a real deletion from a typo'd or stale id. Wire-compatible
  everywhere (the MCP result gains an additive `found` field); the Node
  typings and the TS SDK's `forget` widen `Promise<void>` → `Promise<boolean>`
  — only a caller with an explicit `: Promise<void>`/`: void` annotation on
  the result needs a touch.
  [EPIC-P-071/US-004]

- **BREAKING (Rust core API) — missing graph-edge endpoint is now
  `Error::NodeNotFound` in strict-schema mode too**, unifying it with the
  existing schemaless behavior. The #1442 fix (`add_edge`/`add_edges_batch`
  reject an edge whose `source` or `target` has no stored node payload)
  intentionally kept two variants depending on schema mode: schemaless
  returned `Error::NodeNotFound` (`VELES-022`, REST `404`), while strict
  mode overloaded the pre-existing `Error::SchemaValidation` (`VELES-017`,
  REST `400`) to also mean "endpoint doesn't exist at all". Both modes now
  return `NodeNotFound` for a genuinely missing endpoint;
  `SchemaValidation` in strict mode is reserved for actual schema-shape
  violations (undeclared node type, undeclared edge type, endpoint type
  mismatch, or a node with no `_labels`). *Migration*: code in strict-schema
  collections matching on `Error::SchemaValidation`/`VELES-017`/HTTP `400`
  to detect a missing edge endpoint must match on `Error::NodeNotFound`/
  `VELES-022`/HTTP `404` instead — REST, the Python/Node/WASM/TS bindings,
  and the `velesdb-memory` wedge already map both variants generically by
  error code, so no adapter code changed, only which variant strict mode
  now returns for this one case. (#1470)

### Fixed

- **Benchmark online mode**: the CLI runner now uses the CLI-enforced
  `--output-format stream-json` pairing (parsing the final NDJSON `result`
  event) — the previous `json` output form was rejected by the CLI at the
  first real call; and the online summary now prints per-arm BILLED dollars
  (`total_cost_usd` summed per session) plus cache-field totals, because on
  a caching runner the context lives in cache_creation/cache_read, not
  `input_tokens` (measured: input_tokens≈2 on every turn of both arms).
  [EPIC-P-071]

- **The context compiler no longer aborts on `wasm32-unknown-unknown`** when
  recording savings events: `SystemTime::now()` (unsupported in wasm `std`,
  panics) is only reached on native targets now; wasm events carry a 0
  timestamp (their per-process sequence keeps ids unique, and wasm stats are
  per-browser-session by design). The compile pipeline itself was already
  clock-free. [EPIC-P-071/US-004]
- **python: integers greater than `i64::MAX` now round-trip exactly as `int`**
  (previously silently converted to a lossy `float`). Affects every surface
  sharing the binding's JSON converters — payloads, search results, VelesQL
  params, graph properties, memory metadata — and is required by the context
  compiler's content-addressed ids (FNV-1a 64, uniform over `u64`, so ~50%
  exceed `i64::MAX`). Integers outside `[i64::MIN, u64::MAX]` now raise an
  explicit `ValueError` stating the supported range instead of silently losing
  precision. [EPIC-P-071/US-001]
- **`VectorCollection::traverse_bfs` is now usable** — edges are a
  kind-agnostic feature (`add_edge`/`remove_edge`/`get_outgoing_edges` were
  already shared, see `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` §F2.2 R1.2c: REST `/relations`
  and the agent-memory wedge create edges on any collection kind), but BFS
  traversal was only reachable through `GraphCollection`. `VectorCollection`
  now exposes `traverse_bfs`, delegating to the same shared edge store as
  `GraphCollection::traverse_bfs`. (#1439)

## [3.12.0] — 2026-07-15

Pre-release hardening ("Vague D"): closes the remaining audit follow-ups
surfaced by a line-by-line re-challenge of the engine — WAL-replay
observability, Python governance read-gate parity, and the HNSW memory
footprint — plus the performance, documentation, and CI items found alongside
them. No breaking API changes.

### Added

- **GraphFirst full-scan truncation is now observable.** The filtered-vector
  `GraphFirst` executor caps how many metadata matches it rescores at
  `SCAN_CAP = 100_000` per query (#901 pathological-query guard). The cap is
  unchanged, but when it actually bites (matches were still unvisited when the
  scan stopped) the query now emits **one** structured `tracing::warn!` with
  the collection name, the cap, the matches scored, and an upper bound on the
  unvisited remainder — instead of silently degrading recall. Documented in
  `docs/reference/KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md` with symptoms and workarounds. (WO-D2.)

### Changed

- **HNSW batch-insert path allocates less.** `allocate_batch` no longer
  materializes one prepared-query buffer per vector: raw slices are pushed
  directly into the contiguous storage, and (for the pre-normalized cosine
  configuration) the pushed range is normalized in place under the same write
  lock. Phase B (graph connection) re-derives the normalized query per node
  from a per-thread scratch buffer, keeping at most one owned buffer alive per
  rayon worker instead of one per batch element. Stored bytes are unchanged
  for every metric (verbatim in production; normalized for pre-normalized
  cosine), so recovery byte-comparisons and search scores are unaffected.
  `DeltaBuffer::extend` now materializes incoming entries **before** taking
  the write lock, so deferred-indexing batch copies no longer stall concurrent
  brute-force searches. (WO-D4, PERF2+PERF3.)
- **HNSW vectors are stored once instead of duplicated.** The `ShardedVectors`
  sidecar is removed: rerank, brute-force, vacuum, and persistence now read the
  graph's own `ContiguousVectors` (the single source of truth), cutting up to
  ~1/3 of resident memory on large indices and removing a duplicate
  `native_vectors.bin` from every snapshot. Databases written by older binaries
  are read back unchanged — a legacy `native_vectors.bin` is verified against
  the #617 generation check and then discarded; the file is deleted on the next
  save so a stale copy can never shadow newer graph data. (WO-D11, PERF1.)
- **Payload-mirror upsert prepares rows outside the write lock.** Payload →
  scalar-cell conversion and per-row allocation now run before the mirror state
  write lock is taken; only string interning and store insertion remain under
  it, and the batch stays atomic for concurrent filtered queries. The not-built
  fast path also skips the global write lock entirely during the pre-build
  window. (WO-D5.)

### Fixed

- **WAL replay no longer discards recoverable writes silently.** A vector-WAL
  whose first record is corrupt is no longer misclassified as a legacy
  (pre-CRC) file: format detection now forward-scans for any CRC-valid frame,
  so later valid records behind a damaged one are recovered instead of the
  whole WAL being skipped. A CRC-valid store record whose payload length does
  not match the collection's vector size is now treated as corruption
  (metric + `tracing::warn!`, payload not applied) and its id still lands in
  `touched_ids` so HNSW reconciliation sees the WAL touched it — never a
  silent drop. (WO-D1, BUG4; builds on the earlier WAL crash-safety fixes.)

### Security

- **Governance read-gate parity on the Python SDK.** `Collection.query()`,
  `query_ids()`, `match_query()`, `explain_analyze()`, `scroll()`,
  `scroll_batch()`, `get()`, `all_ids()`, `__contains__`, and the equivalent
  `GraphCollection` VelesQL methods now route through the gated `Database`
  facade (or `authorize_read`/`deny_if_scoped` for id-only and cursor shapes),
  so a registered governance observer's deny/scope decision is enforced on
  every Python read path — closing the bypass where VelesQL `query()` reached
  the ungated detached collection. With no observer registered the behavior is
  unchanged (zero overhead). VelesQL `FROM` on a `Collection` method stays
  nominal (retargeted to the wrapped collection), preserving LangChain /
  LlamaIndex / Haystack adapter semantics. (WO-D3, #1405.)

### Documentation

- `FUSION(maximum)` / `FUSION(average)` now document the cosine-vs-BM25
  scale-mixing caveat (the unbounded BM25 leg dominates; prefer `rrf`/`rsf`),
  in `VELESQL_SPEC.md` and `KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md`. `ColumnStore::add_column`
  documents that it does not backfill and is only sound on an empty store
  (debug-asserted), pointing callers to `add_column_backfilled`. The
  intentional re-match after a bitmap prefilter is documented as a correctness
  invariant (the bitmap can be a superset and never covers the delta buffer).
  (WO-D6, WO-D7, WO-D8.)

### Internal / CI

- The lint job pins the toolchain to 1.90 (matching the `roaring 0.11.4` MSRV),
  runs a targeted `cargo clean` of workspace crates before clippy so the
  incremental fingerprint cache can no longer mask `-D` lints, and runs
  `check-version-sync.py` at PR time. `rust-toolchain.toml` is pinned so local
  builds reproduce CI. CI also now triggers on `Dockerfile` / `docker-compose`
  changes so container-build PRs are no longer merge-blocked by a
  never-posted required check. (WO-D9.)

## [3.11.0] — 2026-07-14

Chief-engineer audit resolution: closes every actionable finding from the
line-by-line `velesdb-core` audit (soundness, quality-gate coverage,
feature-gating, and documentation). No user-facing behavior changes except one
new opt-in feature. The one large item — splitting the `Collection` god-object
backing store — is deliberately deferred as a tracked EPIC (#1384) rather than
rushed on a released core.

### Added

- **Opt-in fail-closed observer mode.** `Database(..., observer_strict=True)`
  (Python) makes an *error* while consulting a `query_request` read policy — the
  callback raising or returning an uninterpretable value — resolve to **deny**
  instead of the default fail-open **allow**. Default is unchanged (fail-open, so
  a bug in policy code never breaks a read); strict mode is for governance / RBAC
  deployments. Explicit decisions (`None`/`True`/`False`/str/dict) are unaffected.
  (Audit F-5.3.)
- **VelesQL query planner is available without the `persistence` feature.**
  `velesql::{planner, explain, cost_estimator, query_stats}` no longer require
  `persistence`; they and their `collection::{stats, query_cost}` /
  `match_planner` dependencies now compile with `--no-default-features`, so
  no-persistence builds (the WASM path) can reach the core planner instead of
  reimplementing it. The persistence build is unchanged. (Audit P1.4.)

### Changed

- **`AnyCollection::into_vector_unchecked` (`unsafe`) → `into_vector_facade`
  (safe).** The method was never memory-unsafe — its body is a plain value move
  between three newtypes that wrap the identical inner `Collection` — so the
  `unsafe` marker (which flagged a *logical* contract) has been removed. The two
  internal Python call-sites drop their `unsafe {}` blocks; the real contract is
  still enforced by the captured `CollectionKind` + `Collection::ensure_vector`.
  Removes the workspace's last logically-unsound `unsafe`. *Migration:* if you
  called `into_vector_unchecked` directly, rename to `into_vector_facade` and
  drop the `unsafe` block (no behavior change). (Audit P0.) *(Note:
  `into_vector_facade` was itself removed after 3.12.0 — see the Unreleased
  section above; use the variant-checked `into_vector()` or, for the
  structural view, `into_vector_view()`.)*
- **Uniform `AnyCollection` dispatch** via a single private `inner()` accessor —
  the shared, identical-across-kinds methods no longer mix `c.method()` /
  `c.inner.method()` forwarding. No behavior change. (Audit P2.6.)
- **`column_store` deletion state unified on `RoaringBitmap`.** Removed the
  redundant parallel `deleted_rows` FxHashSet tombstone set; the bitmap is now the
  single source of truth. (Audit F-2.11.)
- **Quality-gate coverage extended.** `scripts/check_prod_unwraps.py` now scans
  every production crate (adds `velesdb-memory`, `velesdb-node`, `velesdb-python`)
  and recognizes composite test gates like `#[cfg(all(test, feature = "…"))]`;
  the CI `Verify SAFETY template` job now validates unsafe blocks in **all**
  crates, not just `velesdb-core`. (Audit F-3.10 / F-3.11 / F-3.12.)

### Fixed

- Encapsulated `MmapStorage`'s `pub(super)` fields behind accessors and removed
  dead `simd_native` re-exports. (Audit P3.11 / P3.13.)
- Completed the SAFETY template on the Python binding's unsafe block
  (Audit F-3.2) — now superseded by the `into_vector_facade` removal above.

### Documentation

- Clarified `Point::is_metadata_only` semantics (P2.7), disambiguated
  `SearchMode::Perfect` (bruteforce engine) from `SearchQuality::Perfect` (HNSW
  graph effort) (P2.9), and documented the planner strategy realization on SELECT
  (F-2.15), the indexed-metadata scan fallback (F-4.7), read-path-gate ecosystem
  parity (F-5.4), and the per-function NLOC governance model (F-5.13).
- Refreshed the `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` F2.2 tech-debt entry to reflect the safe
  `into_vector_facade` and link the `Collection` split EPIC (#1384). (P2.10.)

## [3.10.0] — 2026-07-14

Delivery release: closes the P0 flagged by the 7-auditor review — the OSS
server registered **no observer at all**, so governance/RBAC hooks were a
complete no-op in the open-core binary regardless of what a consumer
configured. Every read path (HTTP and Python SDK) is now gated end to end.
Plus a memory carry-forward fix, a version-sync gap on the node binding,
routine dependency maintenance, and a documentation pass (recall language,
roadmap currency, an overreaching compliance claim).

### Security
- **server: the governance read-path gate is now live on every HTTP read.**
  `velesdb-server` previously opened the database with `Database::open`
  (never `open_with_observer`), so `on_query_request` never fired in the
  shipped binary — any observer a consumer registered was silently inert.
  Dense/text/hybrid/sparse/batch/multi-query/ids search, `EXPLAIN ANALYZE
  MATCH`, and graph embedding search now all route through
  `Database::gated_search` / `authorize_read`: a `Deny` fails closed (zero
  results, not an error swallowed into success), an allow-with-scope filter
  composes with the caller's own filter, and there is zero overhead when no
  observer is registered. A new end-to-end test drives a denying observer
  through the real HTTP surface and asserts every one of those routes is
  actually blocked, not just the query layer above them.
- **python: the SDK observer gained a read-path veto.** `on_query_request`
  now fires before every gated read and can return `False`/a reason string
  to deny, or a `{"filter": ...}` dict to narrow the result scope — the
  callback was previously notify-only and could not affect the outcome.
- **python: direct `.search()` (and its dense/text/hybrid/sparse/batch/
  multi-query/ids variants, plus graph `search_by_embedding`) now goes
  through the same gate as VelesQL — previously it bypassed governance
  entirely, even with an observer registered. A scope dict with no
  enforceable `filter` (e.g. `{}` or `{"tenant": ...}`, which OSS does not
  itself enforce) is now treated as a deny rather than an accidental
  unscoped allow.

### Fixed
- **memory:** `remember`ing over an existing fact now carries forward its
  reserved `_veles_*` metadata (RL confidence, TTL) instead of resetting it —
  reinforcement learned from prior feedback survives a re-remember.
- **node:** the `velesdb-node` binding had drifted to 0.6.0 (its lockfile
  even further, at 0.4.0) against `velesdb-memory` 0.7.0, so its 5 release
  build jobs failed and the npm publish for that binding was skipped in the
  0.7.0 delivery — bumped in lockstep and the 3 binding manifests are now
  policed by `check-version-sync.py` so this drift can't recur silently.
- **docs:** `BENCHMARKS.md`'s recall language was softened from a guarantee
  to a measured target (HNSW is an approximate index; nothing in the engine
  guarantees 100% recall), and a stale Docker version pin in the README was
  corrected.
- **docs:** the README roadmap table still flagged v3.8 as current while the
  tree had moved to 3.9.1 — added an accurate v3.9 row; softened an
  overreaching "HIPAA-compliant" claim in `BUSINESS_SCENARIOS` to "for
  HIPAA-regulated data" (the product supports that posture, it does not
  itself confer compliance); removed the internal `report/audit-2026q2/`
  code-health analysis from the public tree (the campaign stays named in
  this changelog; nothing public linked those files by path).

### Dependencies
- **`ed25519-dalek` 2.2.0 → 3.0.0** (MAJOR): used for offline license-key
  signing (`veles-license`); the bump required no code changes, CI green
  across the workspace.
- Routine group updates: TypeScript SDK npm deps, GitHub Actions, the
  `dtolnay/rust-toolchain` pin, a 6-crate Cargo `cargo-non-major` group, and
  `pollster` 0.4.0 → 1.0.1.

### Security (acknowledged, not fixed)
- **`glib` 0.18.5 unsoundness** (GHSA-wrw7-89jp-8q8g / RUSTSEC-2024-0429,
  Dependabot alerts #3/#6): pulled in only by the Tauri demo's Linux/GTK3
  backend (`tauri → gtk 0.18 → glib 0.18.5`); no code in `crates/` or
  `demos/` constructs the affected `VariantStrIter`. **Not patched** —
  gtk3-rs is archived upstream at the 0.18 line and Tauri 2.x's Linux
  backend still depends on GTK3, so no available bump reaches glib 0.20.
  The accepted risk and exit path (a GTK4/webkit2gtk-6 migration, not
  before 2026 Q4) are now recorded in `deny.toml` alongside the 7 sibling
  GTK3 advisories already tracked there.

## [3.9.1] — 2026-07-12

Delivery release: everything merged on `develop` since v3.9.0 reaches users —
RL Memory, zero-friction Docker onboarding, security warnings — plus the
release-pipeline gate that prevents partially-harmonised trees from ever
being tagged again. `velesdb-memory` ships as **0.7.0** (new MCP tool).

### Added
- **memory (velesdb-memory 0.7.0): RL Memory** — new MCP `feedback` tool plus
  learned-confidence re-ranking of `recall`. Agents reinforce or weaken
  memories from outcome feedback; ranking adapts over time. Persistent,
  backwards-compatible, gated on the `persistence` feature.
- **memory:** the default hash embedder now warns on stderr that recall is
  lexical, not semantic (silence with `VELESDB_MEMORY_QUIET=1`), so nobody
  mistakes the zero-dep default for semantic search.
- **memory:** agent-memory skill shipped alongside the MCP server, with fixed
  onboarding defaults.
- **server:** warns when binding a public address without authentication;
  README documents the prebuilt `ghcr.io` image (`docker run` quickstart).

### Fixed
- **memory:** RL re-ranking no longer inverts ordering on negative cosine
  similarity.
- **server:** exposed-bind warnings reconciled; loopback detection hardened.
- **release:** a manually-entered `workflow_dispatch` version now strips a
  leading `v` before comparison, so `v3.9.1` and `3.9.1` behave identically.

### CI / Release pipeline
- **REL-07 gate:** `release.yml` now runs `check-version-sync.py` and checks
  tag == workspace version before publishing — a partially-harmonised tree
  can no longer be tagged. All 35 satellite manifests realigned to the
  workspace version.
- `check-version-sync.py` now also polices the MCP registry manifest
  `server.json` against the independently-versioned `velesdb-memory` crate.
- `perf-gate-e2e.yml` aligned on Rust 1.89 (was pinned to 1.86, so the perf
  gate compiled with an older toolchain than the main CI).
- Docker runtime image embeds the LICENSE file.

## [3.8.1] — 2026-07-10

Maintenance release: a full crate + integration health audit closed with a
security patch and a batch of correctness fixes. No API breaks.

### Security
- Patched `crossbeam-epoch` to 0.9.20 (**RUSTSEC-2026-0204**) and dropped the now-stale audit ignores.

### Fixed
- **storage/compaction:** compaction now works on Windows — the data file's memory map is released before the atomic rename, and the WAL is truncated through a write handle (previously `ACCESS_DENIED`). A durable rename barrier orders the swap before WAL truncation, and the live index is kept consistent with the mmap if a commit fails mid-compaction.
- **cli:** `export` and `collection show --samples` iterate the collection's actual point IDs (including points with no payload) instead of an assumed contiguous `1..=n` range — no more silent data loss on sparse IDs.
- **python:** vector search on a graph/metadata collection now raises instead of silently returning `[]`; `CONDITION_TYPES` is re-exported at the package top level.
- **wasm:** persistence preserves the storage mode, quantized buffers and payloads (versioned v2 format); export no longer panics or drops data in SQ8/Binary modes.
- **server:** batch search is offloaded to a blocking worker so it no longer stalls the async runtime.
- **migrate:** graph relation edges are streamed instead of accumulated, avoiding OOM on large relations.
- **langchain:** `from_texts(ids=...)` is honored instead of dropped.
- **llamaindex:** distance scores are mapped to similarity; `delete()` binds its parameters.

### Added
- **ts-sdk:** retry on 429/503 with exponential backoff (503 retried only for idempotent methods, `Retry-After` capped); `bulkDelete`.
- **haystack:** `VelesDBEmbeddingRetriever` component.
- **common:** O(1) cursor scroll via `Collection.scroll_batch`.
- **mobile:** `MobileGraphStore` save/load persistence.

### Changed
- **docs:** roadmap refreshed through v3.8.x with a forward-looking "Next" line; REST endpoint count corrected **48 → 54** across the tree and the promise-contract guardrail; stale version strings realigned.
- **deps:** wgpu 30.0.0, uniffi 0.32.0, plus routine cargo/npm and CI-action group bumps.
## [3.9.0] — 2026-07-07

> Post-cut additions shipped inside the `v3.9.0` tag (the tag was cut on the
> July 11 tree; these were first drafted under a phantom "3.9.1" heading that
> never became a release):
>
> - **Security:** bumped `quinn-proto` 0.11.14 → 0.11.16 (**RUSTSEC-2026-0185**);
>   added `.gitleaksignore` for verified false positives so the secret scan
>   gate stays strict.
> - **Fixed:** `/query` no longer double-fires `on_query` telemetry (one
>   logical query = one event); `velesdb-core` version harmonized to the
>   workspace version (C1), OpenAPI spec regenerated accordingly.
> - **Changed:** dropped unused `ndarray`, `uuid` and `tokio-test`
>   dependencies (`cargo udeps` clean).

### Added
- **Read-path control-plane hook on `DatabaseObserver`.** A new
  `on_query_request(&QueryAccessContext) -> Result<AccessDecision>` method is
  invoked inside the core use-case layer immediately before every read path
  (vector, text/BM25, hybrid, graph `MATCH`, VelesQL `SELECT`) executes. It
  returns an `AccessDecision`: `Allow` (unchanged), `Deny(err)` (aborts with the
  supplied error and zero results), or `AllowWithScope(AccessScope)` (a
  `velesql::Condition` filter is AND-composed into the query's `WHERE` clause
  before execution — narrow-only, never widening). This lets premium enforce
  RBAC, tenant isolation, and audit through the port so every consumer inherits
  it, not just the REST adapter. The method has a default `Allow` implementation,
  so existing observers are unaffected. New public types: `QueryAccessContext`,
  `QueryOperationKind`, `AccessDecision`, `AccessScope`.
- **Stable cross-engine ID hashing (`hash_id`).** `velesdb_core::hash_id(&str)
  -> u64` (FNV-1a) is now a first-class, documented API for deriving numeric IDs
  from strings that are persisted or exchanged between processes/nodes/engines.
  The FNV-1a constants (`FNV_OFFSET_BASIS`, `FNV_PRIME`) are exposed for
  auditability, and `hash_edge_id` is rebuilt on the same core with byte-identical
  output (existing persisted edge IDs remain valid).
- **Compiled lock-rank invariant (`LockRank`).** The global lock-acquisition
  order (`gpu < vectors < columnar < layers < neighbors`) is now a typed
  `LockRank` newtype with a debug-only `assert_lock_order` check (zero release
  overhead) and a reserved premium range `[40, 59]` so premium can order its
  locks relative to core without collision.
- **Shippable WAL cursor (`WalCursor`).** An additive, read-only, forward-only
  API (`WalPosition`, `WalRecord`, `WalConsumerId`, `WalCursor`) over the existing
  WAL framing, plus a low-watermark retention contract so replication consumers
  can resume from a stable position without core truncating records they still
  need. No on-disk format change; existing WALs remain readable.
- **Cross-implementation conformance harness (`conformance`).** Frozen golden
  reference vectors and `check_stable_hash` / `check_rrf` / `check_executor`
  functions that premium (or any alternate engine) can run against its own
  implementations to detect divergence in stable hashing, RRF fusion, and the
  canonical edge-id derivation.
- **Nightly ThreadSanitizer concurrency suite** exercising lock-order
  acquisition across the core lock classes.

### Changed
- **Telemetry is now core-invoked.** `on_upsert` and `on_query` fire exactly
  once from inside the core use-case layer after the data-plane operation
  completes (with the exact affected point count / measured duration in µs),
  so every consumer emits consistent telemetry without callers remembering to
  fire it. The no-observer path stays a single pointer check.
- **Quantization storage-mode docs pin the capacity-vs-speed contract.** `SQ8`
  and `Binary` are documented as **Capacity Modes** (memory reduction only; the
  collection search path stays full-precision f32, no throughput gain), while
  `RaBitQ` and `ProductQuantization` are the wired search-path modes. A
  promise-contract CI guard rejects any doc that claims search throughput for
  `sq8`/`binary`.

### Fixed
- **server:** the `/query` VelesQL endpoint no longer double-fires `on_query`
  telemetry. `Database::execute_query` already invokes the observer's
  `on_query` hook exactly once internally (see "Telemetry is now
  core-invoked" above); the REST handler was additionally calling the
  deprecated `notify_query` shim after every `execute_query` dispatch, so any
  registered `DatabaseObserver` (RBAC/audit/usage billing) counted every
  `/query` request twice. The redundant call — and the per-statement
  collection-name extraction helpers that existed only to feed it — were
  removed; a regression test
  (`query_endpoint_fires_on_query_exactly_once_per_dispatch_branch`) pins the
  exactly-once contract for both `/query` dispatch branches.

### Deprecated
- **`Database::notify_upsert` / `Database::notify_query`** are deprecated (since
  3.9.0). Telemetry is now invoked inside the core use-case layer; callers should
  stop invoking these shims to avoid double-counting once they upgrade. They
  remain working thin shims for backward compatibility and will be removed in a
  future major version.

### Removed
- **Dead `hnsw_delta_wal` module removed from core.** It was never wired into the
  recovery/open/flush path (recovery is fully provided by the 3-pass
  reconciliation against storage as the single source of truth). O(delta) fast
  recovery becomes a premium concern built by consuming the new `WalCursor` seam.
  No on-disk artifact is affected (current versions never wrote a delta-WAL file
  → no migration). A CI guard prevents silent reintroduction.

## [3.8.0] — 2026-07-06

### Changed
- **BREAKING (REST server):** `GET` and `DELETE /collections/{name}/points/{id}`
  now return the point `id` as a JSON **string** (e.g. `"42"`) instead of a
  number, completing the u64 precision-safety migration on the point-object
  endpoints so they match `search`/`scroll`/`relations` (which already emit
  string IDs). JS clients parsing these two responses as numbers must read the
  `id` as a string. The VelesQL `/query` endpoint still emits numeric `id`
  columns (general query results — a separate, tracked follow-up).

### Fixed
- CI: exclude `**/__test__/**` and `**/__tests__/**` from Sonar analysis (the
  Node napi test suite was counted as uncovered production code, failing the
  coverage Quality Gate).

## [3.7.0] — 2026-07-06

### Added
- **`recall_fused` on the MCP and Python bindings** — fused vector+graph recall
  (previously Node/WASM-only) is now available to MCP clients (Claude Code,
  Codex, OpenCode…) and the Python `MemoryService`, with flat `hops`/`graph_boost`
  knobs. (#1314)
- **Dated-context recall on every surface** — `recall_fused` gains a `date_field`
  option (MCP, Python) and a sibling `recallFusedDated` (Node, WASM, TypeScript
  SDK) returning a chronological, "now"-anchored timeline. Powered by the new
  `velesdb-memory::format_dated_context` primitive. (#1315, #1316)

### Fixed
- **u64 IDs are precision-safe across the whole REST OpenAPI spec.** Path/query
  ID parameters, the scroll `cursor`, and `BulkDeleteRequest.ids` were typed or
  accepted as integers only; a client generated from `docs/openapi.{json,yaml}`
  therefore typed IDs above 2^53-1 as a JavaScript `number` and lost precision.
  IDs are now `string` (path/query, `^[0-9]+$`) or `oneOf(integer|string)`
  (bodies), matching the string form every read surface already emits. No wire
  change. (#1321)

### Changed
- LoCoMo positioning and benchmark docs (sourced citations, reproduction through
  the shipped `recall_fused`, the k-budget lever) and the bench harness gains
  `--use-shipped-api` plus a `--full-context` ceiling baseline. (#1313, #1317,
  #1318, #1319, #1320)

## [3.6.0] — 2026-07-03

### Added
- **The agent-memory wedge runs in the browser.** `velesdb-wasm` gains a
  `MemoryService` wasm-bindgen class (remember/recall/recallWhere/recallFused/
  relate/forget/why) over a new in-memory storage backend, and the TypeScript
  SDK (`@wiscale/velesdb-sdk`) gains a matching standalone `MemoryService`
  client with the same typed-error contract as the Node binding. Entirely
  client-side: no server, no network, offline `HashEmbedder`. In-memory only
  under WASM (no persistence) — documented, not silent. (#1310)
- **New public `SemanticMemory::get_metadata_batch` on `velesdb-core`**: one
  collection lookup for a whole batch of ids (same order/length, `None` for
  unknown/expired). Powers the batched recall paths in `velesdb-memory` 0.4.0.
  Additive API — the minor bump that lets the 0.4.0 wedge build against a
  published core. (#1309)
- The workspace CI wasm job now runs the wasm-bindgen test suites in Node
  (previously compile-check only), so JS-marshalling regressions are caught
  in CI. (#1310)

## [3.5.0] — 2026-06-30

### Added
- **Durable TTL on the Python `MemoryService.remember`.** `remember(…, ttl_seconds=…)`
  gives a fact a durable expiry (persisted with the fact, survives a restart; expired
  facts stop being recalled), reaching parity with the MCP server and the Node binding.
  The `velesdb-memory` MCP wedge ships TTL on its own 0.3.0 cadence; this workspace
  release brings the same capability to the Python binding (`velesdb`).

## [3.4.0] — 2026-06-28

### Added
- **New public `SemanticMemory` methods on `velesdb-core`.** `query_excluding`
  (recall while excluding a set of ids — powers hub-exclusion in auto-extraction,
  #1241) and `ensure_index` (lazily build a field's bitmap prefilter index, #1244).
  Additive API; this is the minor bump that lets the `velesdb-memory` 0.2.0 wedge
  build against a *published* core (crate publish compiles against crates.io, where
  these methods must exist).
- **Node.js binding for the agent-memory wedge (`@wiscale/velesdb-memory-node`).**
  A new `crates/velesdb-node` napi-rs addon exposes the high-level `MemoryService`
  in-process to Node (remember/recall/recallWhere/relate/forget/why/
  rememberExtracted), mirroring the Python binding. Depends on `velesdb-memory`
  only (never `velesdb-core`) — the license boundary; in-process, not a service.
  All ops are async; `u64` ids cross as decimal strings (JS 2^53). (#1245)
- **`MemoryService` wedge exposed in the Python SDK.** `from velesdb import
  MemoryService` brings remember/recall/relate/forget/why/remember_extracted to
  Python, reusing the same hardened Rust as the MCP server. (#1242)
- **Indexed prefilter for filtered semantic recall (`recall_where`).** Filtered
  recall now activates a secondary bitmap-prefilter index on first use instead of
  an O(n) post-filter scan, so latency stays flat as the collection grows. (#1244)
- **VelesQL conformance fixture pins the full `VelesqlErrorResponse` shape.**
  Conformance cases C002 (`VELESQL_MISSING_COLLECTION`), C003
  (`VELESQL_COLLECTION_NOT_FOUND`), and C007 (`VELESQL_AGGREGATION_ERROR`) now
  assert all four fields of the semantic error body (`code`, `message`, `hint`,
  `details`), not just the `code`. Parse errors (`QueryErrorResponse`, cases
  C004/C013) retain their own parser-specific shape. Closes `ECOSYSTEM_PARITY.md`
  action item 1. *(Additive: fixture and test only; no server behaviour changed.)*

## [3.3.0] — 2026-06-24

A VelesQL correctness + cross-surface parity release. It closes a large backlog
of silent-wrong-result and clause-drop bugs across the core engine, REST server,
CLI, WASM, and the Python / TypeScript SDKs, and adds executable scalar
subqueries plus several typed SDK ergonomics. Versioned **3.3.0 (MINOR)**: most
changes fix previously-wrong behavior, but several are **client-observable**
(error codes, REST statuses, and query results change). See
[docs/guides/MIGRATION_v3.3.0.md](docs/guides/MIGRATION_v3.3.0.md) before
upgrading.

### Changed
- **New request hard-limits (`400`).** Upserts are capped at 100 000 points per
  request (`MAX_UPSERT_BATCH_SIZE`) and sparse vectors at 65 536 non-zeros
  (`MAX_SPARSE_NNZ`); larger requests are rejected with `400` instead of being
  accepted and degrading the server.
- **Graph / `MATCH` REST error responses now use the canonical `VELES-XXX`
  error codes and correct 4xx HTTP statuses instead of bespoke strings and
  blanket 500s.** `POST /collections/{name}/match` previously hand-rolled
  invented codes (`COLLECTION_NOT_FOUND`, `PARSE_ERROR`, `EXECUTION_ERROR`,
  `NOT_MATCH_QUERY`, `INVALID_THRESHOLD`) with a `hint`/`details` body and
  mapped every execution failure to `500`. It now routes through the shared
  `auto_core_error_response`, so a missing collection returns `404` +
  `VELES-002`, a parse error / non-MATCH query / invalid threshold / unbound
  bind parameter returns `400` + `VELES-010`, etc. The graph edge mutation
  handlers (`POST .../graph/edges`, `.../graph/edges/batch`) likewise route
  through it, so a duplicate edge now returns `409` + `VELES-019` instead of a
  generic `500` string. The search timeout response carries the canonical
  `VELES-027` code (was the malformed `VELES-QUERY-TIMEOUT`), and the
  guard-rail rate-limit (`429`) / circuit-breaker (`503`) responses now include
  the `VELES-027` code in the body (previously `code: null`). *(Behavior change:
  HTTP status codes for several `/match` and graph-mutation client errors move
  from `500` to `404`/`400`/`409`; the `code` field values change; the `/match`
  error body drops the `hint`/`details` fields in favor of the standard
  `{ "error", "code" }` shape. SemVer-observable for REST consumers.)*
- **Query-shape and bind-parameter rejections now classify as `VELES-010`
  (`Query`) instead of `VELES-009` (`Config`).** Live query-path failures that
  describe a malformed *query* — an unsupported query shape (multiple
  `similarity()` under `OR`, `NEAR_FUSED` mixed with another vector predicate or
  under `OR`/`NOT`, more than one `SPARSE_NEAR`, an empty MATCH pattern, a MATCH
  anchor-alias mismatch, `HAVING` without `GROUP BY`, an aggregate `SELECT`
  missing aggregations) and a missing or malformed bind parameter (a `$v` /
  `$sv` not provided, a vector param that is not a numeric array, a sparse param
  that is not a valid index/value map) — were built as `Error::Config` and so
  surfaced with the engine code `VELES-009`. They now build as `Error::Query`
  (`VELES-010`). Genuine engine/collection-configuration errors (distance
  metric, HNSW params, EXPLAIN threshold, group-count cap, NOT-similarity scan
  ceiling) stay `VELES-009`. *(Behavior change: the `code` field and the
  TypeScript SDK error class change from `ConfigError` to `QueryError` for these
  rejections.)*
- **Misconfigured `USING FUSION` clauses now carry a fusion-specific validation
  code/message (`V012`, `FusionMisconfigured`) instead of the misleading `V006`
  (`similarity() requires a vector search context`).** Single-branch FUSION,
  RSF weights that do not sum to 1.0, negative weights, and `weighted`/`rsf` on
  `NEAR_FUSED` now report an honest fusion classification. The engine-level class
  is unchanged (`VELES-010`, `Query`); only the embedded validation code and
  message change. *(Behavior change: the embedded validation `code` for these
  rejections changes from `V006` to `V012`.)*
- **`USING FUSION` is now validated; misconfigured clauses error instead of
  silently degrading.** Five correctness flips, all surfaced at validate-time
  (or parse-time) so the previous silent fallbacks are unreachable:
  - **Single-branch `USING FUSION` is rejected.** Applying `USING FUSION(...)`
    to a query with fewer than two fusable branches (e.g. `similarity()`-only,
    pure `NEAR`, or metadata-only) was a decorative no-op — the clause was
    threaded through and discarded. It now requires at least two fusable
    branches (`NEAR` + `MATCH`, `NEAR` + `SPARSE_NEAR`, …) or a single
    `NEAR_FUSED`, and errors otherwise.
  - **RSF / Weighted weights are validated.** `strategy='rsf'` whose
    `dense_weight` + `sparse_weight` do not sum to ~1.0 (and any negative
    weight) previously degraded to plain RRF at execution time; they now error
    at validate-time so `EXPLAIN` and execution agree. On the `NEAR` + `MATCH`
    `weighted` path a negative `vector_weight` / `graph_weight` was silently
    clamped to `1.0`; it is now rejected at validate-time as well.
  - **`NEAR_FUSED` rejects `weighted` / `rsf`.** Those strategies are
    ill-defined over N homogeneous query vectors; they previously fell back to
    RRF, discarding the weights silently. They are now rejected.
  - **Unknown fusion strategy names and option keys are rejected.** The SQL
    parser previously mapped any unknown `strategy=...` to RRF and discarded
    unknown option keys (`dense_wieght`, …), so a typo silently changed
    semantics. Unknown names/keys now error at parse-time.
  - **`relative_score` is accepted as an alias of `rsf`**, and
    `dense_weight` / `sparse_weight` as long-name aliases of `dense_w` /
    `sparse_w`. The documented long-name weights are no longer silently dropped
    (which used to run a 50/50 blend).
  *(Behavior change: several previously-accepted FUSION queries now error.)*

### Fixed
- **A bare built-in score variable in `ORDER BY` now ranks instead of silently
  no-op'ing.** `ORDER BY sparse_score DESC` (and `vector_score` / `bm25_score` /
  `graph_score` / `fused_score`) was parsed as a payload-field reference, found no
  such field, and fell back to the ascending-id tie-break — a silent ranking
  no-op. Bare score variables now resolve from the result's component-score
  breakdown, identical to the arithmetic form (`ORDER BY sparse_score * 1.0 DESC`).
  *(Behavior change: queries ordering by a bare score variable now actually sort.)*
- **The ordered `MATCH` path (`match_query_ordered`) now enforces the final
  cardinality guard the SQL `/query` path already had.** `finalize_match_ordering`
  (used by non-SQL callers — REST `/match`, the SDKs) omitted the
  `check_cardinality()` call that `finalize_match_results` runs after sorting and
  before LIMIT truncation, so a traversal exceeding the configured cardinality
  limit returned an oversized result set where the SQL path rejects it. The
  guard now runs identically on both paths, returning `VELES-027` (`GuardRail`).
- **WASM aggregate queries now honor `ORDER BY`.** `SELECT cat, COUNT(*) … GROUP
  BY cat ORDER BY COUNT(*)` (or `ORDER BY` a group key / aggregate alias)
  returned groups in undefined order on the WASM executor — the aggregate
  finalize path applied LIMIT without sorting. Grouped rows are now sorted by the
  ORDER BY key(s) (group-key column or aggregate output column, by alias or
  default name) before LIMIT, mirroring core's aggregate ORDER BY semantics.
  Similarity / arithmetic ORDER BY forms (not applicable to grouped rows) are
  skipped, matching core.
- **TypeScript SDK `velesql()` builder now emits parseable VelesQL.** Three
  builder bugs produced strings the core parser rejected or that dropped
  intent: `nearVector({ topK })` emitted a non-existent `vector NEAR $q TOP n`
  (there is no `TOP` keyword — `topK` now maps to `LIMIT`); `toVelesQL()`
  always prefixed `MATCH` and placed `ORDER BY` / `LIMIT` **before** the
  mandatory `RETURN` (MATCH output now always emits `RETURN` first, defaulting
  to `RETURN *`); and `.fusion(...)` rendered an inert `/* FUSION x */` comment
  that dropped the strategy and weights (now a real
  `USING FUSION(strategy='...', ...)` clause). A new `from()` / `select()`
  SELECT mode covers vector / hybrid search (the README "vector similarity with
  filters" example, previously a hard parse error). A round-trip test now feeds
  every builder output through the real `@wiscale/velesdb-wasm` parser.
  *(Behavior change: builder output strings changed — see the SDK README.)*
- **`USING FUSION(strategy = ...)` now takes effect on the dense-`NEAR` +
  text-`MATCH` hybrid.** The hybrid path always ran plain weighted RRF and
  ignored `strategy`, `graph_weight`, and (for `weighted`) the text-branch
  weighting. `maximum` / `average` / `rsf` now run score-level fusion of the
  vector-similarity and BM25 streams; `weighted` normalizes
  `vector_weight` / `graph_weight` so `graph_weight` actually weights the BM25
  branch; `rrf` (and unset) keep the prior behavior. `EXPLAIN` reports the
  strategy that executes. The same fix now also covers the **anchored**
  `NEAR` + graph `MATCH` + text `MATCH` hybrid (AND-required graph predicate):
  it previously always ran RRF over the anchor set, ignoring `strategy` /
  `graph_weight`; it now honors them while the anchor-restricted result set is
  unchanged.
  *(Behavior change: non-`rrf` FUSION on NEAR+MATCH changes rankings.)*

### Added
- **TypeScript SDK: typed `db.setAutoReindex()` / `db.alterCollection()` and a
  typed `nearFused()` builder.** `db.setAutoReindex(name, bool)` and
  `db.alterCollection(name, { autoReindex })` route a valid
  `ALTER COLLECTION ... SET(auto_reindex=...)` through the existing `/query`
  path (previously only reachable via a raw `db.query()` string). The query
  builder gains `nearFused(paramNames, vectors, { strategy })` for multi-vector
  fused search; its `strategy` type only allows `rrf` / `average` / `maximum`,
  so the `weighted` / `relative_score` trap (which the engine silently degrades
  to RRF over homogeneous query vectors) is a **compile-time error**. Purely
  additive.
- **Scalar subqueries are now executable end-to-end (EPIC-039).** A
  `(SELECT ...)` in a `WHERE`/`HAVING` predicate or an `INSERT`/`UPDATE` value is
  executed and substituted as a literal before the outer query runs, instead of
  being rejected at validation with `V010`. The inner SELECT must return exactly
  one row and one column: 0 rows resolve to `NULL` (a comparison against `NULL`
  is never true), and more than one row or column errors with a clear
  cardinality message (`VELES-010`). Aggregate subqueries
  (`(SELECT AVG(amount) FROM t)`), single-column row projections
  (`(SELECT amount FROM t WHERE id = 1)`), `BETWEEN`/`IN`/`CONTAINS` value
  positions, `INSERT`/`UPDATE` values, and **`UPDATE`/`DELETE` `WHERE`**
  predicates are all supported; nesting is bounded at 8 levels.
  `UPDATE … WHERE col > (SELECT … )` and `DELETE … WHERE id = (SELECT … )` now
  resolve the subquery to a literal *before* the mutation runs (previously the
  predicate silently saw `NULL` and matched no rows). A subquery whose inner
  `WHERE` filters on a **payload path** (e.g. `… WHERE meta.cat = 5`) is a plain
  payload filter, not a correlation, so it executes instead of being wrongly
  rejected. Resolution lives in `velesdb-core`, so the REST `/query` endpoint and
  the CLI REPL gain it for free (both route through `Database::execute_query`).
  **Correlated** subqueries (whose inner `WHERE` references one of the *outer*
  query's tables/aliases) remain rejected at validation with `V010`. WASM, which
  has a separate executor, still rejects subqueries.
- **`ALTER COLLECTION <name> SET (auto_reindex = true|false)` now applies and
  persists.** Previously parsed but rejected with a feature-gap error, it now
  attaches (or re-configures) an `AutoReindexManager` on the collection and
  persists the policy, so the setting survives a restart (restored on the next
  open). Setting `false` keeps the policy attached but disabled, preserving any
  configured thresholds. Unknown options and non-bool values still error.
- **EXPLAIN ANALYZE now flags approximate graph-traversal counters.** The REST
  `actual_stats` object carries a new machine-readable boolean
  `traversal_counters_approximate` (mirroring `node_stats.estimated`): `true`
  when `nodes_visited` / `edges_traversed` are strategy-dependent approximations
  (a lower bound — `VectorFirst` undercounts via its `limit(1)` BFS frontier,
  `Parallel` double-counts shared nodes), `false` for non-graph queries where
  both counters are 0. The `node_stats` heuristic time/row fields and the
  `VELESQL_SPEC` are relabeled so the estimated values are no longer presented as
  measured/actual. *(Additive: the field is appended to `actual_stats`.)*
- **CLI `query execute` accepts `--collection`/`-c`.** A bare `MATCH` (or any
  query without a `FROM` clause) can now target a collection from the one-shot
  `velesdb query execute <db> "..." --collection <name>` command, mirroring the
  REST `/query` collection field. Previously such queries failed with the
  REPL-only "use a collection" error and no way to specify one.
- **CLI REPL now applies session settings to queries.** `\set mode` /
  `\set ef_search` are injected into a vector query's `WITH(...)` options before
  execution (an inline `WITH(...)` always wins), and `\set max_results` caps the
  effective `LIMIT`. Previously these were stored and displayed but never applied.
  `timeout_ms` and `rerank` have no execution channel yet, so `\set` now warns
  that they are display-only instead of implying they take effect.
- **`match_query_ordered` ordered-MATCH entry point on the collection types.**
  A new public `Collection::match_query_ordered` (re-exported on
  `VectorCollection` and `GraphCollection`) runs a MATCH clause through the
  cost-based planner and returns ordered `MatchResult`s with RETURN `ORDER BY`,
  the deterministic `(node_id, depth, path)` tie-break, and the post-sort
  `LIMIT` applied — identical to the SQL `/query` path. It is the single source
  of truth for non-SQL surfaces (REST `/match`, the SDKs) that need ordered
  graph rows, so they rank identically instead of re-implementing ordering or
  returning raw traversal order. *(Additive: new method; existing
  `execute_match` / `execute_match_with_similarity` are unchanged.)*
- **WASM errors now carry a machine-readable `code`.** Browser rejections were
  bare `Error(message)` strings, so clients could not narrow them — contradicting
  `ERROR_CODES.md`, which promises an `error.code` on every client surface. A
  dimension-mismatch search now rejects with a structured `Error` whose
  non-enumerable `code` property is `"VELES-004"`, an invalid collection name
  with `"VELES-034"`, and a `VelesQL` parse failure (`VelesQL.parse`) with
  `"VELES-010"`. The code is single-sourced from `velesdb_core::Error::code()`
  (no WASM-local taxonomy); the property is non-enumerable so it does not appear
  in `JSON.stringify(error)`. *(Additive: the `message` text is unchanged.)*
- **Python `SearchOptions` accepts a `fusion=` strategy for typed hybrid
  dense+sparse search.** A new optional `fusion: Optional[FusionStrategy]`
  field (plus a `with_fusion()` builder) is threaded through `search_request`
  so RSF / weighted hybrid fusion is reachable without raw `USING FUSION` SQL.
  When omitted (or `None`) the search keeps the historical Reciprocal Rank
  Fusion (RRF, k=60), so behavior is unchanged for existing callers.
  *(Additive: new optional field/builder; default preserved.)*
- **Python `Database.set_auto_reindex(name, enabled)` toggles auto-reindex at
  runtime.** Routes a validated `ALTER COLLECTION <name> SET (auto_reindex = …)`
  through the VelesQL DDL executor (persisted), the typed counterpart to running
  the raw statement via `execute_query`. `Collection.info()` now also reports the
  current `auto_reindex` flag. *(Additive.)*

### Fixed
- **Python `match_query` honors `RETURN ... ORDER BY` and the post-sort
  `LIMIT`.** The Python bindings now route a non-similarity `MATCH` through the
  core `match_query_ordered` cost-based planner (the SQL `/query` single source
  of truth) instead of a bare traversal entry point, so `ORDER BY` + post-sort
  `LIMIT` rank identically to the SQL path on both `Collection` and
  `GraphCollection`.
- **Python `explain()` reports calibrated SELECT plans, real MATCH strategies,
  and rejects invalid queries.** `Collection.explain` now threads the
  collection's live indexed-field set and statistics through the core planner,
  so a SELECT whose `WHERE` targets an indexed field emits an `IndexLookup` node
  with a calibrated cost, and a MATCH reports a real traversal strategy instead
  of a bare/zeroed plan. Semantically invalid queries (e.g. a `WHERE` subquery)
  now raise `ValueError` instead of silently building a plan.
- **EXPLAIN of a MATCH query now shows the graph traversal and its strategy.**
  `EXPLAIN`/`EXPLAIN ANALYZE` of a MATCH query (REST `/query/explain`, core
  `Database`/`Collection` explain paths) previously emitted a bare empty
  `TableScan` mislabeled `MATCH` because the plan builder never routed MATCH
  clauses through the traversal planner. The plan now carries a `MatchTraversal`
  step with a real, non-empty strategy (`GraphFirst` / `VectorFirst` /
  `Parallel`), and the Database/Collection explain paths thread the live graph
  `CollectionStats` so the chosen strategy reflects the actual graph shape.
  *(Behavior change: the EXPLAIN plan steps for MATCH queries change.)*
- **CLI `$parameter` vector queries now error instead of silently succeeding.**
  A REPL/`query execute` `SELECT`/`MATCH` whose `WHERE` references a `$param`
  vector (unsupplyable from the CLI) used to print a yellow note and return zero
  rows with a success exit code, so scripts treated it as an empty result. It now
  returns an error (red message, non-zero exit) while keeping the guidance to use
  literal vectors or the REST API.
  *(Behavior change: such CLI queries now exit non-zero.)*
- **Unpopulated built-in score variables now default to `0`, not the primary
  score.** In `ORDER BY`/`LET` arithmetic, a built-in score component absent from
  a result's component breakdown (e.g. `bm25_score` on a `NEAR`-only query) used
  to resolve to the fused/primary `search_score` instead of `0`, so a hybrid
  formula like `0.7 * vector_score + 0.3 * bm25_score` evaluated to the full
  vector score rather than `0.7 ×` it. Tagged results now default an absent
  component to `0` (per `VELESQL_SPEC`); untagged legacy results keep the
  `search_score` fallback. `graph_score` (never populated) is reserved and
  resolves to `0` on tagged results.
  *(Behavior change: hybrid `ORDER BY`/`LET` scores using an unpopulated
  component change ranking.)*
- **`ORDER BY similarity(field, $v)` now scores the named vector field.** The
  `SELECT`-side `ORDER BY similarity(image_vec, $q)` ignored the field and always
  scored the default vector, so rows were ranked by the wrong vector. It now
  resolves each row's named payload vector (missing/length-mismatched vectors
  sort last, matching the `MATCH`-side convention).
  *(Behavior change: queries ordering by a named/secondary vector re-rank.)*
- **`ORDER BY` on a nested/dotted payload field now sorts.** `ORDER BY meta.source`
  did a flat top-level lookup, so every row compared equal and the sort was a
  silent no-op. Dotted paths now walk nested objects (consistent with
  projection/filter/aggregation).
  *(Behavior change: previously-unsorted queries now sort.)*
- **`EXPLAIN ANALYZE` reports real graph traversal counters.** `nodes_visited`
  and `edges_traversed` for `MATCH` queries were a fabricated proxy equal to the
  result-row count; they now report the actual walk — edges followed and nodes
  reached — across all MATCH strategies (GraphFirst walk; VectorFirst candidate
  evaluation + per-candidate existence-BFS; Parallel sums both legs). The values
  are an approximate lower bound (the VectorFirst existence-BFS uses `limit(1)`
  and undercounts the frontier; Parallel double-counts nodes touched by both
  legs). Non-graph queries report `0/0`. The REST/OpenAPI response shape is unchanged.
  *(Behavior change: the reported counter values change.)*
- **`MATCH ... ORDER BY` now sorts arithmetic and `similarity(field, $v)`, and
  errors on the rest.** Previously only `similarity()`, `depth`, and
  `alias.property` sorted; arithmetic over a property (e.g. `ORDER BY year - 2000`)
  and explicit `similarity(field, $v)` were silently dropped (mis-ordered rows).
  They now sort. Aggregates (no `GROUP BY`) and bare aliases are rejected with
  `VELES-018` instead of being silently ignored.
  *(Behavior change: previously-silent queries now sort or error.)*
- **`MATCH ... ORDER BY ... LIMIT` now returns the GLOBAL top-K.** Traversal
  early-broke once it had `LIMIT` candidates and only *then* sorted, so an
  `ORDER BY` LIMIT selected the sorted-top-K of the first-K rows *traversed*
  rather than the globally ordered set (e.g. `ORDER BY year DESC LIMIT 2` could
  return the two lowest years that happened to be visited first). When an
  `ORDER BY` is present, traversal now visits the full candidate set (bounded by
  the shared `MAX_LIMIT` ceiling and the guard-rails) before sorting and
  applying the LIMIT; without an `ORDER BY`, the LIMIT-on-traversal-order
  early-break is preserved. A start-`similarity()` `MATCH` that `ORDER BY`s a
  non-similarity field — which would otherwise pick the approximate-HNSW
  `VectorFirst` strategy and rank only a similarity-bounded prefix — now routes
  to `GraphFirst`'s exact enumeration, so the global top-K holds (deterministically)
  across all traversal strategies. Affects the SQL `/query` path and every
  surface that finalizes through it.
  *(Behavior change: `MATCH ORDER BY ... LIMIT` results change when the global
  top-K differs from the first-K traversed.)*
- **`NEAR_FUSED` multi-vector fusion now executes via SQL.** It previously parsed
  into a condition with no executor and silently degraded to an unranked full
  scan that ignored the query vectors and `USING FUSION`. A SQL `NEAR_FUSED` now
  routes to the engine's multi-vector fusion (`multi_query_search`): per-vector
  search + ranking fusion, honoring `USING FUSION 'rrf'/'average'/'maximum'`
  (others fall back to RRF) and any residual metadata predicate as a pre-fusion
  filter.
  *(Behavior change: previously-silent full scans now return fused rankings.)*
- **`NEAR_FUSED` isolation is now enforced with an error.** A `WHERE` may contain
  exactly one `NEAR_FUSED`, only `AND`-ed with a metadata filter. More than one
  `NEAR_FUSED`, mixing it with another vector predicate (`NEAR` /
  `similarity()` / `SPARSE_NEAR`), or placing it under `OR`/`NOT` previously
  parsed and silently degraded to a non-fused scan; these shapes are now
  rejected.
  *(Behavior change: previously-silent degraded queries now error.)*
- **WASM `SELECT` now projects columns, aliases, and window functions.** A
  plain/vector `SELECT` in the browser runtime always returned `id` + `score` +
  the full payload, ignoring the projection list: `SELECT category` returned
  every field, `SELECT title AS name` kept `title`, and
  `ROW_NUMBER()/RANK() OVER (...)` columns were dropped entirely. The finalize
  path now runs core's window evaluator before sorting and projects each row by
  the parsed `SELECT` list (id-precedence, dotted-path lookup, alias handling,
  similarity-score materialization), matching the REST surface.
  *(Behavior change: WASM `SELECT` rows now carry only the requested columns.)*
- **WASM `SELECT ORDER BY` arithmetic now sorts, and a LIMIT-less `SELECT`
  defaults to 10 rows.** `ORDER BY (price - 2 * score)` (and other arithmetic /
  score-variable expressions) used to map to a no-op `Equal` comparison, so rows
  came back in scan order; they now evaluate the formula per row (mirroring
  core's arithmetic semantics, division-by-zero → 0). `ORDER BY
  similarity(field, $v)` against a named vector — which WASM does not store —
  and aggregate `ORDER BY` outside aggregation are now **rejected loudly**
  instead of silently no-op'ing (parity with the MATCH path). A `SELECT` with no
  `LIMIT` now caps at `DEFAULT_SELECT_LIMIT` (10) like every other surface,
  rather than returning every row.
  *(Behavior change: WASM ORDER BY re-orders / errors, and unbounded SELECTs cap
  at 10.)*
- **WASM single-vector `NEAR` + `USING FUSION` no longer leaks filtered rows.**
  A `vector NEAR $v AND <metadata> USING FUSION(...)` query fused the real vector
  ranking against a synthetic constant-`1.0` payload branch and returned the
  fused UNION, so rows failing the `WHERE` metadata predicate leaked into the
  result (and `weighted`/`rsf` rankings were meaningless). The metadata predicate
  is now applied as a **hard filter** (parity with core), so only matching rows
  survive; `weighted` / `rsf` over a single-vector `NEAR` (which has no second
  scored branch in WASM) are **rejected** with a clear error. `rrf` / `maximum`
  / `average` keep ranking the (now hard-filtered) vector results.
  *(Behavior change: WASM fused single-`NEAR` queries drop WHERE-failing rows;
  weighted/rsf single-branch fusion errors.)*
- **WASM `EXPLAIN` now uses the core plan vocabulary.** The browser EXPLAIN
  renderer emitted divergent node labels (`Scan`, `NestedLoopJoin`,
  `LimitOffset`, `GraphPatternMatch`) under `{step, node, detail}` keys that did
  not match the REST `/query/explain` taxonomy. Rows now carry the same wire keys
  as the REST `ExplainStep` (`step`, `operation`, `description`, `estimated_rows`,
  `estimation_method`) and the same `operation` vocabulary as core's
  `PlanStep::rest_operation()` (`VectorSearch`, `FullScan`, `Filter`,
  `{Type}Join`, `GroupBy`, `Aggregate`, `Sort`, `Limit`, `Offset`,
  `MatchTraversal`); the leading scan carries an `estimated_rows` row-count hint.
  WASM-only concerns with no core plan node (`FUSION`, `DISTINCT`) fold into a
  step's description rather than inventing an out-of-taxonomy operation. Core's
  `to_plan_steps()` itself is `persistence`-gated and unreachable from the
  no-persistence WASM build, so the renderer mirrors the vocabulary rather than
  re-exporting it. *(Behavior change: WASM EXPLAIN row keys/labels change.)*

### Documentation
- **VelesQL `LET` clause docs reconciled with the engine's real support.** The
  spec's `LET`-before-`MATCH` example and `GRAPH_PATTERNS.md`'s "LET before MATCH
  has no effect" note were stale — the engine **rejects** `LET` on `MATCH`,
  `SPARSE_NEAR`, `NEAR_FUSED`, `NOT similarity()`, and `OR`/union queries with an
  explicit error. `docs/VELESQL_SPEC.md` now enumerates these unsupported shapes
  in the LET Rules section and documents that ranking by a built-in score on an
  excluded shape (e.g. `sparse_score` on a `SPARSE_NEAR` query) requires the
  **arithmetic** form (`ORDER BY sparse_score * 1.0 DESC`); a *bare*
  `ORDER BY sparse_score` parses as a payload-field reference and is a ranking
  no-op (falls back to ascending-id tie-break). Locked by two new core tests.
- **WASM README parity claims made truthful.** The feature table and prose now
  state that the WASM executor projects columns/aliases/window functions, sorts
  `SELECT ORDER BY` arithmetic and `similarity()`, applies a default `LIMIT 10`,
  emits `VELES-*` error codes, and uses the core EXPLAIN plan vocabulary, while
  enumerating the genuine REST-only carve-outs it loudly rejects (`LET` bindings,
  scalar subqueries, single-`NEAR` `weighted`/`rsf` FUSION, and named-vector
  `ORDER BY similarity(field, $v)`).
- **CLI `.hybrid-sparse` usage and `.help` now list all accepted fusion
  strategies** (`weighted` and `relative_score` were accepted but undocumented,
  shown only as `rrf|average|max`).
- **TypeScript `capabilities()` gains VelesQL sub-capability fields**
  (`velesqlFusionStrategies`, `velesqlMatchOrderBy`, `velesqlAlterCollection`)
  so clients can branch on finer-grained support.
- **Python `Collection.search()` docstring** now states that hybrid dense+sparse
  search fuses with RRF (k=60) and that fusion overrides require
  `search_request(SearchOptions(fusion=...))`.

## [3.2.1] — 2026-06-20

Patch release. Maintenance only — no engine/API change (`velesdb-core` and the
REST/OpenAPI surface are functionally identical to 3.2.0).

### Fixed
- **TypeScript SDK pulls the matching WASM runtime.** `@wiscale/velesdb-sdk`
  now depends on `@wiscale/velesdb-wasm` `^3.0.0` (was `^2.0.0`), so consumers
  of the 3.x SDK get the 3.x WASM runtime instead of a stale 2.x. The 2.0.0 →
  3.x WASM API is purely additive, so this is transparent for SDK consumers.
- **Docs: correct LlamaIndex package name.** The integration is published on
  PyPI as `llama-index-vector-stores-velesdb`; the docs previously referenced
  the non-existent `llamaindex-velesdb` (a 404 for anyone following the install
  instructions).

## [3.2.0] — 2026-06-20

Minor release. Single-sources the server `EXPLAIN` plan onto `velesdb-core`
(the source of truth) and adds the supporting public API. Additive: the REST
response shape and `docs/openapi.{json,yaml}` are unchanged.

### Changed
- **REST `EXPLAIN` single-sourced from core.** `POST /query/explain` no longer
  reconstructs the plan from the parsed AST; it now maps the engine's canonical
  query plan via the new `velesdb_core::velesql::QueryPlan::to_plan_steps()` —
  the same `PlanNode` tree the CLI `.explain` renders. The response **shape**
  (keys/structure) and the `operation` vocabulary are unchanged (`FullScan`,
  `{Type}Join`, `Filter`, `GroupBy`, `Aggregate`, `Sort`, `Limit`, ... are all
  preserved), and `docs/openapi.{json,yaml}` are unchanged. The `features` and
  `estimated_cost` response objects remain server-derived (single-sourcing them
  is a follow-up).
- **CLI/Python `EXPLAIN` now shows `JOIN` / `GROUP BY` / aggregation / `ORDER BY`
  steps.** The core `PlanNode` tree gained `Join`, `GroupBy`, `Aggregate`, and
  `Sort` nodes, so `QueryPlan::to_tree()` now renders them (previously only the
  REST view surfaced these). Filter row estimates flow natively from the plan,
  removing the prior server-side estimation merge.
- The `VectorSearch` step's `estimated_rows` is now `null` (it previously echoed
  the query `LIMIT`). The limit estimate is still reported on the `Limit` step,
  where it is unambiguous.
- A `vector NEAR` query that also carries a non-vector `WHERE` predicate (e.g.
  `vector NEAR $v AND price > 100`) now surfaces a dedicated `Filter` step in the
  REST/CLI `EXPLAIN` plan. The prior AST reconstruction suppressed it (its
  `has_filter` flag was `false` whenever a vector search was present), yielding
  `[VectorSearch, Limit]`; the single-sourced plan reports the filter that
  actually runs, `[VectorSearch, Filter, Limit]`.

### Added
- `velesdb_core::velesql::QueryPlan::to_plan_steps() -> Vec<PlanStep>` — the
  canonical, structured EXPLAIN step list (with `PlanStep`/`PlanStepKind` and the
  `PlanStep::rest_operation()` wire mapping), single-sourced with `to_tree()`.

### Fixed
- An indexed-equality predicate may now surface an `IndexLookup` step in REST
  `EXPLAIN`, which the prior AST reconstruction never emitted.
- A query with `OFFSET` but no `LIMIT` (compound/`MATCH`) now surfaces a proper
  `Offset` step instead of the previous degenerate `Apply LIMIT 0 OFFSET N`.

> Known follow-ups (deliberately out of scope, recorded for future work):
> - The pre-existing in-response inconsistency between `plan[].operation`
>   (`FullScan`) and `node_stats[].node_label` (`TableScan`) is left as-is;
>   reconciling it is a breaking relabel deferred behind the SemVer boundary.
> - `velesdb-wasm` keeps its own AST-walking `EXPLAIN` renderer with an
>   independent vocabulary (`Scan`, `NestedLoopJoin`, `GraphPatternMatch`, ...):
>   the core `QueryPlan`/`to_plan_steps` machinery is `persistence`-gated and
>   unavailable in the no-persistence WASM build, so full convergence is deferred.

## [3.1.0] — 2026-06-20

Minor release. Single-sources several ecosystem components onto `velesdb-core`
(the source of truth) and adds the supporting public API. **No breaking Rust API
changes** — every addition is additive and the core config structs are
`#[non_exhaustive]`.

> ⚠️ **Potentially breaking for externally-persisted derived IDs.** The
> auto-derived identifiers produced by the WASM, `velesdb-migrate`, and
> LangChain/LlamaIndex layers now match `velesdb-core`'s canonical hashing (they
> previously diverged per engine). This is a correctness/convergence fix — core's
> own IDs are unchanged and there is **no on-disk format change** — but if you
> persisted these auto-derived IDs into an external store, re-ingesting the same
> logical edge/entity will now yield a different ID. Rebuild affected persisted
> graphs.

### Added
- `velesdb_core::wire::hash_edge_id(source, target, label)` — the canonical
  edge-ID hash, exported at the crate root and `wasm32`-safe (lives in `wire/`,
  not behind the `persistence` feature).
- `velesdb_core::CONDITION_TYPE_NAMES` and `DISTANCE_METRIC_NAMES` — the canonical
  filter-condition and distance-metric name vocabularies; surfaced in Python as
  `velesdb.CONDITION_TYPES`.
- Mobile `VelesError::Database` now carries `code` (the core `VELES-###` taxonomy
  code) and `recoverable` (mirrors `velesdb_core::Error::is_recoverable`), exposed
  over UniFFI.

### Changed
- **Edge IDs single-sourced.** WASM and `velesdb-migrate` auto edge IDs now use
  `velesdb_core::wire::hash_edge_id` (was a monotonic counter / a string-hash);
  core IDs are unchanged.
- **Fusion single-sourced.** WASM sparse RRF and the Tauri sparse path now
  delegate to `velesdb_core::FusionStrategy::fuse` (ranking identical to core).
- **WASM binary 1-bit quantization** sign convention now matches core (`>= 0.0`
  sets the bit; `0.0` now sets the bit). In-memory only — no persisted artifact.
- **Migrate metric canonicalization** routes through `DistanceMetric::parse_alias`;
  the TOML schema is unchanged. Migrate-only aliases `cos`/`euclid`/`l2_distance`/
  `inner_product`/`cosinesimilarity` are dropped; `l2`/`ip`/`inner` now resolve.
- **Mobile error `Display`** now prepends the `[VELES-###]` code.

### Fixed
- **LangChain & LlamaIndex graph IDs** now use the canonical
  `velesdb_common.ids.stable_hash_id` (60-bit → 63-bit); persisted graphs created
  by older versions must be rebuilt.
- **WASM PQ/RaBitQ fallback** no longer silently degrades to SQ8 — it emits a
  one-time `console.warn` (the fallback behaviour itself is unchanged).

### Performance
- In-place permutation in scalar `ORDER BY`, and fewer intermediate allocations in
  the aggregator, window-partition, and layer hot paths (no behavioural change).

### Internal
- Executor-level VelesQL conformance extended to multi-column `ORDER BY`, the
  ascending-id tie-break, and bounded top-k, now running across the core, CLI, and
  WASM executors (`conformance/velesql_executor_cases.json`).
- `MobileGraphStore` documented as a deliberate RAM-only graph fork
  (`KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md` #14).
- Test-authenticity audit: removed redundant/fake tests and corrected several
  assertions across the workspace.

## [3.0.1] — 2026-06-16

Maintenance release. **No functional changes** — the published artifacts are
equivalent to 3.0.0 (only tests, CI/quality config, and the version bump
changed). This release adds test coverage for code introduced in 3.0.0 and
corrects the SonarCloud coverage scope.

### Internal
- **Coverage:** ~2,600 lines of native tests across `velesdb-core`,
  `velesdb-server`, `velesdb-cli`, `velesdb-migrate`, the Tauri plugin
  (mock-runtime command-handler tests), `velesdb-wasm`, and `velesdb-mobile`,
  covering new code from 3.0.0 (VRB1 wire codec, ordered-index decline branches,
  multi-query fusion strategies, graph edge-property validation, and more).
- **SonarCloud:** exclude `velesdb-python` from coverage measurement — its pyo3
  code is exercised by the pytest suite, not `cargo`, so it has no LCOV data and
  was incorrectly counted as 0%-covered. Measured workspace coverage is ~81.7%.

## [3.0.0] — 2026-06-16

A **major release**. The sole backward-incompatible change is to the
`velesdb-core` Rust crate API — the public configuration structs are now
`#[non_exhaustive]`. Everything else since 2.0.0 is additive: index-backed
`ORDER BY` pushdown, durable secondary indexes, streaming ingestion across the
ecosystem, binary bulk paths, and broad binding parity. The SDKs
(Python / TypeScript / REST / mobile / WASM) and the on-disk data format remain
backward compatible — a 2.0.0 data directory opens unchanged.

**Breaking — read before upgrading:**
- **`velesdb-core` config structs are `#[non_exhaustive]`.** `CollectionConfig`,
  `LimitsConfig`, `AutoReindexConfig`, and the ingestion `StreamingConfig` can no
  longer be constructed (or exhaustively destructured) with a struct literal from
  outside the crate. Build them via the `VectorCollection::create*` constructors,
  `StreamingConfig::new`, or `Default` + field assignment. This makes future field
  additions non-breaking. **No effect on the SDKs, the REST API, or stored data.**

### Added
- **Index-backed `ORDER BY <col> LIMIT k` pushdown (EPIC-081).** Scalar
  single-column, `WHERE`-filtered, and multi-column `ORDER BY` now serve top-k from
  an ordered secondary index instead of an O(n) fetch-then-sort (~89 ms → ~0.01 ms
  over 50k rows), plus an `ORDER BY` index advisor that surfaces eligible queries.
- **Durable secondary indexes.** `CREATE INDEX` field definitions persist in
  `config.json` and are rebuilt from payloads on open, so an index survives a
  process restart (previously a `CREATE INDEX` was silently lost, changing the
  fast-path/EXPLAIN behaviour after a restart while results stayed correct via the
  exhaustive fallback).
- **Streaming ingestion across the ecosystem.** Core `StreamingConfig` +
  persistence; `enableStreaming` / `streamInsert` on the TypeScript and mobile
  SDKs; `Collection.enable_streaming` (Python); REST + Tauri `enable_streaming`.
- **Binary bulk ingestion paths.** WASM `VectorStore.insertBatchRaw` (flat buffer),
  CLI `VRB1` import via the shared core codec, and a REST `upsert_bulk_from_raw`
  binary endpoint.
- **Binding parity.** `search_ids`, `multi_query_search_ids`, `batch_parallel`,
  `reorder_for_locality`, `apply_advanced_config`, `compact_storage`, batch graph
  edges, `collection_diagnostics`, guardrails, and the auto-reindex lifecycle
  exposed to Python / mobile / CLI / Tauri; `DatabaseObserver` lifecycle callbacks
  (Python / server / Tauri); WASM cross-collection `@collection` MATCH enrichment
  and `VectorStore::search_sparse`.
- **Integrations.** Haystack fusion kwarg and named-sparse-index creation for
  LangChain / LlamaIndex / Haystack; canonical metric/storage names single-sourced
  from core.

### Changed
- **`ORDER BY` is now correct under `LIMIT` and deterministic.** Scalar
  `ORDER BY <col> LIMIT k` sorts the full matching set **before** truncating (e.g.
  `ORDER BY year DESC LIMIT 2` now returns the two newest rows, not the first two by
  id), and equal-key rows get a stable ascending point-id tie-break. **Results
  change for affected bounded/tied queries.**
- **`WITH (ef_search = N)` honors the exact budget** via a custom search quality
  instead of snapping to one of four named buckets; the Balanced default `ef_search`
  is now `160` (was `128`).
- **Runtime enforcement of `limits.*`.** `max_vectors_per_collection`,
  `max_payload_size`, and `max_perfect_mode_vectors` now hard-error
  (`GuardRail VELES-027`) on ingest/search for collections that opted into a
  non-default limit (previously configured-but-ignored; the permissive defaults are
  unchanged).
- **Python `update_guardrails` rejects partial/unknown dicts** (full-replacement
  contract) instead of silently applying serde defaults to omitted fields.
- `CollectionConfig` on-disk schema bumped v1 → v2 (persists auto-reindex,
  streaming, and indexed-field config). Backward compatible on read: a v1
  `config.json` deserializes with defaults.

### Internal
- pyo3 / numpy upgraded to 0.29.
- All jscpd code-duplication eliminated (0 findings) via behavior-preserving
  Extract Method; config structs hardened with `#[non_exhaustive]`.

## [2.0.0] — 2026-06-12

A **major release**. Two correctness fixes to behavior shipped in 1.18.0 — the
persisted HNSW graph is now reloaded at open instead of silently rebuilt, and
durable point TTL is now enforced on every read path — ship alongside new
graph/agent-memory capability and behavior-breaking changes to VelesQL and the
distance engine. The major bump follows strict SemVer: the VelesQL query
semantics below change results for existing queries.

**Breaking — read before upgrading:**
- **VelesQL variable-length relationship aliases bind LISTS** (openCypher
  semantics): a `*1..3` alias projects a per-edge list; `*1..1` is no longer a
  scalar — read element 0. Fixed-length `-[r:T]->` aliases are unchanged.
- **MATCH row cardinality**: aliased parallel edges now yield one row per
  aliased edge (previously collapsed); rows carry `_edge_bindings` /
  `_edge_paths`. Unaliased `-[:T]->` patterns are unchanged.
- **MATCH without `LIMIT`** now uses the 100 000-row ceiling (was a silent
  cap of 100 rows).
- **`DistanceEngine` dimension checks assert in release builds** (were
  debug-only): a length mismatch panics instead of reading out of bounds
  through the safe public API.

Each item is detailed (and marked **BREAKING** where applicable) under the
sections below.

### Changed
- **`DistanceEngine` dimension checks now assert in release builds** (were
  debug-only): a length mismatch panics instead of reading out of bounds
  through the safe public API.
- **BREAKING (VelesQL) — variable-length relationship aliases bind lists
  (openCypher semantics)**: `MATCH (a)-[r:T*1..3]->(b)` now binds `r` to the
  ordered LIST of traversed relationships instead of the last edge.
  `RETURN r` projects the edge-id list, `RETURN r.prop` projects the
  positional per-edge value list (previously a scalar — including for the
  degenerate `*1..1` range), and `WHERE r.prop` uses ANY-element semantics
  (previously last-edge). Fixed-length aliases (`-[r:T]->`) keep their scalar
  behavior. Migration: queries templating a `*1..1` range that read `r.prop`
  as a scalar must read element 0 of the projected list instead.
- **MATCH row cardinality with aliased parallel edges**: result dedup now
  includes relationship bindings, so two parallel edges between the same node
  pair yield one row per ALIASED edge (previously they collapsed to one row).
  Unaliased patterns (`-[:T]->`) keep the collapsed cardinality. Result
  payloads now carry `_edge_bindings` / `_edge_paths` alongside `_bindings`
  so rows are distinguishable by edge identity.
- **Implicit MATCH anchor binding (V011 relaxed)**: when a
  `SELECT ... WHERE vector NEAR ... AND MATCH (...)` pattern does not
  reference the FROM alias, the pattern's anchor node now binds to the FROM
  alias implicitly; guards G1–G3 reject inverted, ambiguous, or multi-anchor
  patterns with actionable errors naming both aliases. The flagship
  agent-memory query — `SELECT memory.*, similarity() FROM agent_memory AS
  memory WHERE vector NEAR $embedding AND MATCH (ctx)-[:RELATES_TO]->(fact)
  AND session_id = $current_session ORDER BY similarity() DESC LIMIT 10` —
  now runs verbatim, covered by end-to-end BDD tests.
- **Implicit `LIMIT 10` is a documented contract**: a `SELECT` without a
  `LIMIT` clause has always returned at most 10 rows; the default is now a
  shared named constant, the VelesQL spec and guides state it, and `EXPLAIN`
  displays the implicit limit instead of omitting it.
- **Strict-schema node-type validation (#1082)**: `store_node_payload` on a
  collection with a strict schema now rejects node payloads whose node type
  is not declared in the schema (previously accepted silently).
- **ColumnStore auto-vacuum triggers automatically**: the
  PostgreSQL-inspired vacuum threshold is now wired into the delete path
  (payload-mirror delete application), so tombstone compaction runs without
  a manual `vacuum` call.
- **Durable point TTL enforced on every read path**: `search`, `get`,
  `scroll` and VelesQL `query` now all filter points whose
  `_veles_expires_at` has passed; previously an expired point could still be
  returned by some read paths until the next expiry sweep.

### Added
- **LangChain MMR + by-vector search** (`langchain-velesdb`):
  `max_marginal_relevance_search`, `max_marginal_relevance_search_by_vector`
  and `similarity_search_by_vector` are now implemented (previously raised
  `NotImplementedError` from the base class), including
  `as_retriever(search_type="mmr")`. `similarity_search_with_score` now
  normalises cosine scores from `[-1, 1]` to `[0, 1]` on the dense path.
- **GraphFirst anchored fetch — exhaustive hybrid retrieval**: `MATCH (...)`
  predicates that are AND-required by a SELECT WHERE clause are now evaluated
  FIRST; retrieval happens within their anchor sets and is exhaustive (a
  matching row is returned no matter how it ranks globally). Covers
  `vector NEAR` (exact scoring up to 10K anchors, bitmap-filtered HNSW
  beyond), metadata-only, sparse-only (per-id index filter, exact at LIMIT),
  and `NOT similarity()` shapes. Residual shapes (OR/NOT-wrapped predicates,
  `similarity()` cascades, text/hybrid fusion) keep the bounded window,
  now documented per shape. Anchor sets are evaluated once and shared with
  the exact WHERE post-filter.
- **Agent memory graph dimension — relate() API**: each memory subsystem
  (semantic/episodic/procedural) gains `relate(from, to, rel_type, props)`,
  `relations(id)` and `unrelate(edge_id)`. Relation edges are typed,
  WAL-durable, reject expired/missing endpoints, and cascade away when a
  memory is deleted — `MATCH (m)-[:RELATES_TO]->(f)` is now executable over
  agent memory, completing the flagship NEAR + MATCH + scalar query
  end-to-end. Under the hood, the graph dimension is now first-class on
  every collection type: edge WAL durability, the flush-time snapshot +
  WAL compaction, and delete-cascade are unconditional (previously gated to
  graph collections — vector-collection edges silently vanished on restart
  and the WAL never compacted); edge property indexes are rebuilt from the
  snapshot on open (previously lost after compaction, graph collections
  included); edge WAL appends are ordered with their store apply so replay
  resolves id collisions exactly like live execution; and memory snapshots
  (`serialize`/`snapshot`) now capture relation edges and restore them
  (previously a restore silently wiped every relation). Older bare-array
  snapshots still load.
- **RaBitQ wired end-to-end in the collection query path, restarts included**:
  collections created with `storage = 'rabitq'` now build the binary-traversal
  HNSW backend, and `TRAIN QUANTIZER … type = rabitq` installs the trained
  quantizer into the live index in addition to persisting `rabitq.idx`. On
  open, `rabitq.idx` is reloaded and every stored vector is re-encoded in
  NodeId order (O(n·d), same cost class as gap recovery). Vacuum preserves the
  RaBitQ backend and re-installs the trained quantizer instead of silently
  downgrading to the Standard f32 backend.
- **Durable post-hoc TTL setters for agent memory**: Result-returning
  `set_semantic_ttl_durable` / `set_episodic_ttl_durable` /
  `set_procedural_ttl_durable` on `AgentMemory` (and `set_ttl_durable` on each
  subsystem) persist the expiry to the reserved `_veles_expires_at` payload
  field so it survives a restart; refreshing an expired or missing id returns
  `NotFound`. The in-memory `set_*_ttl` setters are now documented as volatile.
- **ColumnStore in the SELECT WHERE path (#1075)**: adaptive per-collection
  payload mirror compiles metadata filters to RoaringBitmap scans once
  sequential-scan debt justifies the build; secondary indexes keep precedence.
- **CI (#1076)**: full TypeScript SDK vitest suite on every PR; nightly 100K
  recall@10 ≥ 0.95 gate (`perf-gate-e2e` schedule + manual dispatch).
- **WeightedRRF fusion strategy (#1082)**: reciprocal-rank fusion with
  per-source weights and 0-based ranks; weights are revalidated on the
  `fuse()` path like the other weighted strategies.
- **REST + TypeScript SDK parity for relations and durable TTL (#1082)**:
  `relate`/`unrelate`/`getRelations` and `setTtlDurable` are exposed over
  REST (`POST /collections/{name}/relations` (create),
  `GET /collections/{name}/points/{id}/relations`,
  `/collections/{name}/relations/{edge_id}`,
  `/collections/{name}/points/{id}/ttl`) and in `@wiscale/velesdb-sdk`, with
  the OpenAPI spec regenerated and the SDK methods covered by tests.
- **`GET /metrics` served by default**: the `prometheus` feature is now a
  default feature (previously opt-in), so released binaries and the Docker
  image expose the endpoint out of the box; documented in the OpenAPI spec; it
  stays behind API-key auth whenever keys are configured.
- **Release artifacts ship a `SHA256SUMS` file**; `install.sh` verifies the
  downloaded archive against it.
- **Python durable TTL for episodic and procedural memory**:
  `set_episodic_ttl_durable` / `set_procedural_ttl_durable` bindings bring
  the PyO3 SDK to parity with the Rust durable TTL setters.
- **Agent-memory criterion benchmark**: `agent_memory_benchmark` (semantic
  store/query/hybrid NEAR + MATCH, episodic record/recent, procedural recall
  at 10K facts/events and 1K procedures, 384-dim) plus measured figures with provenance in the
  agent-memory guide (Apple M5 Pro: `semantic.query` 55.5 µs at k=10,
  `episodic.recent` 24.7 µs, NEAR + MATCH ~5.5 ms at 1,000 anchors, `store`
  12.1 ms — fsync-dominated).
- **Mobile `uniffi-bindgen` binary**: `velesdb-mobile` now ships the
  documented `uniffi-bindgen` binary, and the Swift/Kotlin
  bindings-generation flow it documents is verified.

### Fixed
- **Scalar `$param` equality in `WHERE` silently matched nothing** on v1.18.0
  (e.g. `WHERE session_id = $current_session` returned zero rows while the
  literal form matched) — fixed as part of the GraphFirst/WHERE evaluation
  rework (#1082); covered by the flagship-query BDD test which binds both a
  vector and a scalar parameter.
- **Tauri plugin: 25 registered commands had no Tauri v2 permission** and were
  unreachable from the webview (the extended AgentMemory surface shipped in
  v1.18.0); all 63 commands now carry permissions and the sync test parses the
  registration source as ground truth, so the gap cannot silently recur.
- **`MATCH ... RETURN` without `LIMIT` silently capped results at 100**: the
  default is now the server-wide 100 000-row ceiling, matching the documented
  contract (pinned by a >100-row BDD test).
- **Persisted HNSW graph was never reloaded at open**: `Collection::open` now
  loads the serialized `index.hnsw` and reconciles it in 3 passes against the
  vector store and WAL (stale entries dropped, missing vectors re-indexed,
  a mutated index re-saved); previously the persisted graph was ignored and
  the index was rebuilt by re-inserting every vector on every open.
- **`HnswParams.alpha` never reached the native graph (#1082)**: the
  configured diversification alpha is now propagated to the native graph
  constructor and persists across restarts.
- **Lazily-trained RaBitQ quantizer now persists at flush**: parity with PQ —
  previously only an explicit `TRAIN QUANTIZER` persisted `rabitq.idx`, so a
  lazily-trained quantizer vanished on restart.
- **TTL expiry TOCTOU on the MATCH result path (#1082)**: the expiry
  timestamp is snapshotted once before the result loop and expired points
  are skipped inline, closing the window where a point could expire between
  payload retrieval and the expiry check.
- **Test suite compiles under `--no-default-features`**: the weekly
  Miri/cargo-careful gate is unblocked (it could not build the suite before).
- **`velesdb-migrate` test flakiness**: `validate_url` tests no longer mutate
  process environment variables (a policy parameter is injected instead),
  removing cross-test interference.
- **LangChain test suite green in full runs** (`langchain-velesdb`): a
  leaked module fake from `test_core_feature_parity` broke 17 unrelated
  tests; `sys.modules` is now restored after the fixture loads.
- **`TRAIN QUANTIZER 'rabitq'` trained an index nothing ever loaded**: the
  persisted `rabitq.idx` had zero load-path callers, the persisted HNSW meta
  hardcoded `StorageMode::Full` on save, and the collection load path ignored
  the storage mode — so after a reopen a RaBitQ collection silently searched
  f32 forever. `HnswIndex::save` now persists the actual backend mode and the
  load/open paths honour the collection storage mode and restore the trained
  quantizer.
- **PQ persistence round-trip**: `Collection::open` now reloads the trained PQ
  codebook (`codebook.pq`, plus `rotation.opq` for OPQ) and rebuilds the PQ
  cache by re-encoding stored vectors (O(n) at open). Previously the codebook
  saved by `TRAIN QUANTIZER` was never loaded, leaving the ADC rescore path
  inert after a restart.
- **Quantization docs honesty**: `docs/guides/QUANTIZATION.md` now states
  precisely which modes are wired into the collection query path — RaBitQ and
  PQ end-to-end; SQ8/Binary collection modes maintain caches that no search
  path consumes (search stays full-precision f32), pending a reduced-memory
  storage mode.
- **LlamaIndex `delete(ref_doc_id)` was a silent no-op for chunked documents**
  (`llama-index-vector-stores-velesdb`): it deleted only the hash of
  `ref_doc_id`, never the chunks. Nodes now persist `ref_doc_id` in their
  payload and `delete()` removes every matching chunk (paged scan past the
  VelesQL LIMIT-10 default). The LlamaIndex Quick Start (README + docstrings)
  now goes through `StorageContext` — the previously documented
  `from_documents(..., vector_store=...)` call silently indexed into an
  in-memory store, leaving the VelesDB collection empty.
- **LangChain GraphRetriever `low_latency=True` required a graph collection**
  it never used (`langchain-velesdb`, same fix in the LlamaIndex retriever);
  vector-only mode now works without one.

### Removed
- **`server_url` parameter of both `VelesDBVectorStore` classes**
  (`langchain-velesdb`, `llama-index-vector-stores-velesdb`): it was accepted
  and validated but never used — no server mode exists in these connectors;
  every operation runs against the embedded local database. Passing it now
  raises `TypeError` instead of silently doing nothing, and the misleading
  "Server Mode" README sections are gone. Use the REST API to talk to a
  remote `velesdb-server`.

## [1.18.0] — 2026-06-07

### Changed
- **Licensing — engine-embedding artifacts realigned to VelesDB Core License 1.0
  (#1053)**: every first-party artifact that ships the compiled engine
  (`velesdb-{wasm,python,mobile,cli,migrate}`, `tauri-plugin-velesdb` + its
  guest-js, `@wiscale/velesdb-sdk`) is now governed by the source-available
  VelesDB Core License instead of MIT. Glue/connectors/examples without the
  engine (`integrations/*`, `examples/*`, `demos/*`) stay MIT. New
  `docs/LICENSING.md` documents the matrix and the rule.
- **BREAKING (TypeScript SDK) — `ProceduralPattern.embedding` is now required
  (#1039)**: procedural patterns were stored without a vector, so procedural
  recall (a pure vector search) could never return them. Patterns now persist
  their `embedding` as the point vector and the field is required on the
  `ProceduralPattern` type. Migration: pass your model's embedding when learning
  a procedure, exactly as you already do for semantic and episodic memory.

### Added
- **Python agent-memory bindings (#1045)**: expose TTL, snapshots, serialize and
  the VelesQL memory bridges from the PyO3 SDK, all routed through the shared
  core memory instance.
- **Tauri agent-memory commands (#1046)**: add the missing semantic/episodic/
  procedural commands (TTL store, delete, serialize/deserialize, recall-similar,
  reinforce, list) with typed error propagation via `From<AgentMemoryError>`.
- **Core semantic-memory CRUD helpers (#1044)**: batch store, get, list, count,
  is-empty and clear helpers on `SemanticMemory`.

### Fixed
- **Agent memory TTL & expiry hardening (#1040, #1043)**: over-fetch before
  truncation so expired-but-present top-k entries no longer crowd out live
  results; `store_with_ttl(.., 0)` now eagerly deletes instead of shadow-expiring
  a live point; `auto_expire` only drops a TTL entry once its delete succeeds.
- **Procedural memory recall returned empty (TypeScript SDK, #1039)**: see the
  breaking change above — patterns are now recallable via vector search.
- **Mobile/WASM semantic memory lost content (#1041)**: knowledge content is now
  persisted in the point payload and survives reload; adds `delete` and keeps
  `clear` at parity across mobile and wasm.

## [1.17.0] — 2026-06-05

### Added
- **VelesQL parser error hints (#987)**: syntax errors now carry friendlier
  messages with "did-you-mean" suggestions, making malformed queries far easier
  to fix from the CLI/REST error response.

### Fixed
- **Payload WAL crash recovery (#1011)**: a crash mid-append no longer leaves a
  collection unopenable — replay now stops cleanly at a torn-tail record and
  keeps every prior entry (mirrors the vector WAL's torn-tail policy).
- **Vector retrieve overflow guard (#1012)**: the copy-path bounds check now
  uses checked arithmetic so a corrupt near-`usize::MAX` index offset returns an
  error instead of panicking on the slice.
- **Hybrid fusion weight validation (#1013)**: `Weighted` / `RelativeScore`
  weights are now validated on the `fuse()` path, so strategies built directly
  from server/CLI/SDK request fields can no longer yield unnormalized scores.
- **HNSW alpha validation (#1015)**: an out-of-range `alpha` (`< 1.0` or
  non-finite) is now rejected at the REST (`400 Bad Request`), Python
  (`ValueError`) and Tauri boundaries instead of silently degrading recall or
  violating the `HnswParams` `Eq` invariant. Valid `alpha` (default `1.2`,
  anything `>= 1.0`) is unaffected.
- **CLI flag toggles (#997)**: `--include-vectors` and `--progress` are now
  real toggles instead of no-ops.
- **Python SDK onboarding (#986)**: canonical metadata-filter format, search-API
  migration off the deprecated `collection.search()`, auto-dimension detection,
  and dunder forwarding on the lazy `_PendingCollection` proxy after it
  materialises.
- OpenAPI spec now types point `id` as `string` for `/search`, `/search/ids`,
  `/scroll` and graph result endpoints, matching the on-the-wire format (these
  responses quote the ID to preserve `u64` values above `2^53-1`). Schema-only
  change, no behaviour change. A CI drift check now keeps the committed
  `docs/openapi.{json,yaml}` snapshots in sync with the generated spec.
- OpenAPI spec now models request body `id` fields as `oneOf` integer or
  string, matching the input contract (both forms are accepted; string avoids
  JavaScript precision loss above `2^53-1`). Schema-only, no behaviour change.

### Removed
- **CLI**: removed the non-functional `--schemaless` flag from
  `collection create-graph`. The flag was a no-op (graphs were always
  created schemaless regardless of its value); drop it from any scripts —
  `velesdb collection create-graph <path> <name>` is unchanged in behaviour.

### Changed
- **VelesQL subqueries (#993)**: a WHERE-clause subquery is now rejected at
  validation with a clear error instead of silently returning NULL.
- Public docs, tests, and SDK source comments no longer reference
  maintainer-local engineering-rule files; they point to the public
  `QUALITY_BAR.md` or describe the rule inline.
- Removed an unused CLA automation-bot signer and a vestigial branch-name
  pattern from the PR-governance allowlist.

### Performance
- **HNSW search (#1001)**: replaced the shared probe-RNG CAS in the search path
  with a thread-local XORshift64, removing per-search lock contention.

## [1.16.0] — 2026-05-29

### Summary

Second **minor** bump of the v1.1x line. Two themes dominate: a **security/robustness hardening wave** (the `audit-2026q2` campaign — 9 integrated fix PRs across the HNSW loader, WAL, PQ quantization, sparse/BM25 agent path, graph integrity, query/caches, parser, and config layers) and a **developer-experience expansion** (first-party embedding adapters for Python and TypeScript, a VelesQL cheat sheet, and a multi-arch GitHub Container Registry image). Both are **additive** — no breaking change in the public Rust, Python, TypeScript, or WASM SDK surface.

For most users the headline is *zero-friction RAG*: you can now `from velesdb import embed` and wrap OpenAI or `sentence-transformers` without writing glue code, pull a published `ghcr.io` image instead of building the server yourself, and keep the one-page VelesQL cheat sheet open while you query. For operators and library integrators, the hardening wave tightens every untrusted-input boundary (on-disk index/WAL loading, query parsing, rate limiting, config loading) with explicit bounds and validation — defense-in-depth, with no behavior change on well-formed inputs.

This release also folds in a 44-PR dependency refresh (Rust toolchain base image `1.87 → 1.96`, `wgpu 29`, `redis 0.26 → 1.2`, `pyo3-build-config 0.24 → 0.28`, `rustyline 14 → 18`, `dashmap 5 → 6`, `dirs 5 → 6`, plus the demo/CI ecosystem) and a documentation accuracy sweep (factual-accuracy passes, the ecosystem-parity audit, and per-integration docstring corrections).

### Added

- **First-party embedding adapters — Python** ([#917](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/917)). New `velesdb.embed` module exposing an `Embedder` protocol plus two ready-to-use implementations: `OpenAIEmbedder` (wraps the `openai` client) and `SentenceTransformerEmbedder` (wraps `sentence-transformers`). Both are opt-in — their backing libraries are soft dependencies loaded lazily, so the base `velesdb` wheel stays dependency-light. Lets you go from raw text to a populated collection without hand-writing embedding glue.
- **First-party embedding adapter — TypeScript** ([#917](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/917)). New `OpenAIEmbedder` class plus `Embedder` interface and `OpenAIEmbedderOptions` type, exported from the SDK root (`@wiscale/velesdb-sdk`).
- **VelesQL cheat sheet** ([#917](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/917)) — `docs/reference/VELESQL_CHEATSHEET.md`, a one-page quick reference of the query surface (search, filter, graph MATCH, fusion, sparse, EXPLAIN).
- **Multi-arch GitHub Container Registry (GHCR) publish** ([#917](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/917)) — new `docker-publish.yml` workflow building and pushing a multi-architecture `ghcr.io` image with OIDC build-provenance attestation and a guarded `latest` tag, complementing the existing release-artifact pipeline.
- **Tauri plugin: typed guest-js wrappers for 9 previously raw-only commands** ([#928](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/928)). `train_pq`, `stream_insert`, `traverse_graph_parallel`, `create_index`, `drop_index`, `list_indexes`, `sparse_search`, `hybrid_sparse_search`, and `sparse_upsert` were registered in the Rust invoke handler but had no typed JS wrapper, forcing callers into untyped `invoke('plugin:velesdb|<cmd>', …)` calls. Each now has a camelCase request/response interface and an exported async wrapper. No Rust change.

### Security

> The `audit-2026q2` campaign is defense-in-depth hardening of untrusted-input boundaries. There is no known exploit and no behavior change on well-formed inputs; each fix adds explicit bounds/validation where a malformed file or query could previously over-allocate, panic, or skip a check.

- **HNSW on-disk load validation + allocation safety** ([#908](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/908), integrates [#894](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/894)/[#899](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/899)). Loading a persisted HNSW index now validates structural invariants and caps allocations derived from header fields, so a corrupt or hostile index file can no longer trigger an unbounded allocation.
- **WAL allocation caps, replay ordering & durability** ([#911](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/911), integrates [#898](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/898)). Write-ahead-log replay enforces allocation caps and a well-defined ordering, hardening crash-recovery against truncated/oversized records.
- **PQ quantization hardening** ([#909](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/909), audit item B).
- **Parser DoS bounds** ([#910](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/910), audit item E) — guards against pathological query inputs.
- **Sparse / BM25 agent-path hardening** ([#912](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/912), audit item D).
- **Graph-integrity hardening** ([#913](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/913), audit item G).
- **Query & cache hardening** ([#914](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/914), audit items H, I).
- **Config validation enforced in loaders + on open; RateLimiter bounded** ([#915](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/915), integrates [#907](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/907)). Invalid configuration is now rejected at load time and on database open rather than surfacing later; the rate limiter has an explicit upper bound.
- **`audit-2026q2` behavior documented** ([#916](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/916)). The hardening guarantees are written into `docs/SOUNDNESS.md`, `docs/STORAGE_FORMAT.md`, `docs/CONCURRENCY_MODEL.md`, `docs/reference/KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md`, `docs/reference/NATIVE_HNSW.md`, and the VelesQL spec/contract, so the invariants are discoverable, not folklore.
- **5-angle code-health audit + targeted fixes** ([#871](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/871)) and **property-test / dead-code sweep** ([#875](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/875)).

### Changed

- **Dependency refresh (44 PRs).** Notable majors: Docker base image `rust 1.87 → 1.96-bookworm` ([#918](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/918)), `wgpu 29` migration ([#869](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/869)), `redis 0.26 → 1.2` ([#884](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/884)), `pyo3-build-config 0.24 → 0.28` ([#885](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/885)), `rustyline 14 → 18` ([#831](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/831)), `dashmap 5 → 6` ([#830](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/830)), `dirs 5 → 6` ([#832](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/832)), `openssl 0.10.78 → 0.10.80`. GitHub Actions majors: `checkout 4 → 6`, `upload-artifact 4 → 7`, `cache 4 → 5`, `sonarqube-scan 2 → 8`, `docker/login` & `docker/setup-buildx 3 → 4`. Demo toolchain: `vite 7 → 8` + `@vitejs/plugin-react 4 → 5` ([#888](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/888)), `tailwindcss 3 → 4` ([#859](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/859)). All absorbed without public-API impact.
- **Dependabot grouping + advisory hygiene** ([#810](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/810), [#811](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/811)): non-major bumps are grouped, JS example dirs gained coverage, and `deny.toml` advisory waivers are organized with a review-date marker.

### Fixed

- **CLI: stop advertising a non-existent `.guardrails set` command** ([#936](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/936)).
- **Mobile: repaired broken/misleading graph-collection doc references** ([#929](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/929)).
- **Python stub: `TraversalResultDict` keys now match the PyO3 binding output** ([#844](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/844)).
- **Core: aligned GPU feature gates** ([#847](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/847)).
- **TS SDK: `ignoreDeprecations` to unblock npm publish under TypeScript 6.0** ([#802](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/802)).
- **WASM build repaired on `develop`** — `DEFAULT_ALLOC_BYTE_LIMIT` (1 TiB) overflowed `usize` on 32-bit/WASM targets; now cfg-gated ([#917](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/917), regression from #908).
- **Clippy: allow wildcard SIMD intrinsic imports on aarch64** ([#889](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/889)).
- **`scripts/check-version-sync` detects velesdb-python capabilities across all sub-modules** ([#873](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/873)).
- **Demo: tauri-rag-app builds on Vite 8 via the oxc minifier** ([#937](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/937)).

### Performance

- **`fix+perf(core)`: zero-alloc `LIKE` hot path, O(n log n) index backfill, dead-cast removal, robust streaming test** ([#805](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/805)).
- **Zero-copy BM25 text extraction + eliminate duplicate allocation in `LabelTable::intern`** ([#887](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/887)).
- **Skip WAL fsync when deleting an id that was never stored** ([#890](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/890)).
- **`sort_unstable_by` sweep + reduced reindex log allocation** ([#848](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/848)) and a general code-quality pass ([#841](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/841)).

### Documentation

- **Factual-accuracy passes against the code** ([#836](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/836), [#837](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/837)) — server `/metrics` auth, server perf numbers, mobile UniFFI constructor, CLI `.nodes` duplicate, and more.
- **Ecosystem-parity audit corrections** ([#927](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/927)) and per-integration docstring fixes: WASM README VelesQL execution ([#926](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/926)), Haystack 5 distance metrics ([#930](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/930)), server `collection_type`/HNSW params/sparse search ([#931](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/931)), Python secondary-index helpers ([#932](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/932)), migrate sparse-vector source support ([#933](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/933)), LangChain RSF `relative_score` ([#934](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/934)), cross-collection `@collection` MATCH scope ([#935](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/935)).
- **VelesQL spec refreshed** ([#838](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/838)) and a **5-second Python first-search quickstart** ([#839](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/839)).

### CI / Tooling

- **Perf Gate (E2E) workflow** enforcing recall ≥ 0.95 and a p50 sanity floor ([#808](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/808)), plus a **Balanced-mode recall contract for Euclidean and DotProduct** ([#809](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/809)).
- **Feature-claims audit promoted to a blocking gate** with its test suite wired in ([#874](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/874)).
- **Loom check made a required gate** instead of silently skipped ([#823](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/823)); example/demo smoke jobs extended to the new React/Express examples and the RAG-PDF demo ([#806](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/806), [#829](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/829)); heavyweight python-integrations job now also runs on `develop` pushes ([#834](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/834)).

### Notes on Migration

This release is **drop-in for every public API**. New surfaces (`velesdb.embed`, TS `OpenAIEmbedder`, the 9 Tauri wrappers) are purely additive and opt-in. The `audit-2026q2` hardening changes only the handling of malformed/hostile inputs; well-formed workloads see no behavior change. The dependency refresh is fully internal to the workspace.

## [1.15.0] — 2026-05-14

### Summary

First **minor** bump of the v1.14 line — additive features across the agent-memory, query-cost, and SDK surfaces, plus a full dependency refresh including two ecosystem majors (`rand 0.9 → 0.10`, `toml 0.8 → 0.9`) absorbed without API breakage. No user-facing breaking change in the public Rust, Python, TypeScript, or WASM SDK APIs. The release also closes the first two RAG-stack example demos (`examples/react-wasm-search` standalone Vite+WASM, `examples/node-express-rag` containerized REST backend), the Python auto-dimension inference long-requested in #379, and the ACT-R Phase 1 procedural learning module behind `feat(agent)`.

The CI gate cleanup work (45 commits since v1.14.4) is the largest of any minor release on this line: SAFETY-template strict-mode verifier now polices every `unsafe` block, the makefile cargo-make tasks now mirror the strict pre-push sequence byte-for-byte, and the v1.13.2-frozen architecture snapshots in `QUALITY_BAR.md` / `ARCHITECTURE.md` were dereferenced to live CI references that auto-refresh.

### Added

- **ACT-R Phase 1 — procedural learning** ([#780](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/780), [#796](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/796), closes [#433](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/issues/433)). Power-law decay, diminishing-returns rescaling, and a `CompositeStrategy` combining the two are now exposed on `AgentMemory`. Opt-in via the new strategy enum — existing behaviour unchanged.
- **CBO feedback calibration in `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`** ([#784](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/784), Phase 2 of [#469](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/issues/469)). The planner now reports its empirical `ms_per_cost_unit` EMA in `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` output, letting users see how the optimizer's cost model drifts against real wall-clock for their workload.
- **Python: auto-detect vector dimension from first upsert** ([#778](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/778), closes [#379](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/issues/379)). Calling `Collection.upsert(points)` on a collection created without `dim=N` now infers the dimension from `points[0]` and locks the collection to that shape — the previous "dim required at create time" friction is gone.
- **Python: `SearchOptions` builder** ([#761](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/761), closes [#717](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/issues/717)). Fluent builder for assembling complex search queries (`SearchOptions.with_fusion(...).with_payload_filter(...).with_quality(...)`) — additive, the kwargs API still works.
- **TypeScript SDK: `sparseIndexName` and RSF weights in the REST backend** ([#779](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/779), closes [#380](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/issues/380)). Brings the REST backend to parity with the WASM backend for named sparse indexes (the WASM backend still silently drops `sparseIndexName` — documented in [#793](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/793) below).
- **Standalone React + Vite + WASM vector-search demo** ([#794](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/794), closes [#348](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/issues/348)) under `examples/react-wasm-search/`. Zero-backend, pure browser vector search with a UMAP scatterplot and a payload filter form. CSP-clean, COOP/COEP-clean.
- **Express.js + Docker RAG backend example** ([#795](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/795), closes [#350](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/issues/350)) under `examples/node-express-rag/`. Containerized reference for "drop VelesDB into an existing Node REST API".

### Changed

- **`rand` ecosystem bumped from 0.9 to 0.10** ([#797](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/797)). Workspace `rand` and `rand_distr` both moved to their latest majors. Trait-import migration applied: `Rng::random()` / `Rng::random_range()` moved to the new `RngExt` trait — 16 source files updated. Side effect: `rand 0.10` pulls `getrandom 0.4` directly (instead of 0.3 transitively), so `velesdb-wasm` and `velesdb-core` now declare both `getrandom_03` and `getrandom_04` with `wasm_js` feature, ensuring the WASM target builds cleanly regardless of which version any dependency resolves to.
- **`toml` bumped from 0.8 to 0.9** ([#755](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/755)). Internal absorption of the 0.8 → 0.9 breaking change in `core_feature_parity_tests`. No user-facing API surface affected.
- **`tauri` bumped 2.10 → 2.11**, **`reqwest` 0.12 → 0.13**, **`hyper` 1.8 → 1.9**, **`ndarray` 0.16 → 0.17**, **`uniffi` 0.28 → 0.31** ([#759](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/759), [#753](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/753), [#754](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/754), [#757](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/757), [#773](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/773)). All internal, no public-API impact.
- **TS SDK dev tooling bumped to 2026 floors** ([#752](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/752), [#748](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/748), [#770](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/770)): `eslint 8.57 → 10.3`, `typescript 5.9 → 6.0`, `eslint-config-prettier 9 → 10`. Dev-only — does not affect the published package.
- **`Makefile.toml` cargo-make tasks aligned with the strict pre-push sequence** ([#788](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/788)). `cargo make ci` now exactly mirrors what the `CI` workflow runs, so a green local `cargo make ci` predicts a green PR check.
- **`CboFeedbackLoop` visibility tightened from `pub` to `pub(crate)`** ([#791](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/791)). The struct was never re-exported from `velesdb-core::lib` and was always intended to be crate-internal; this is a tightening of accidental over-exposure, not a breaking change for any known user.
- **`docs/sdk/ts/README.md` clarifies `sparseIndexName` vs `sparseSearchNamed`** ([#793](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/793)). REST backend supports both; WASM silently drops `sparseIndexName` and throws `wasmNotSupported` on `sparseSearchNamed`. Previously implicit; now explicit in JSDoc and README.
- **`QUALITY_BAR.md` and `ARCHITECTURE.md` v1.13.2-frozen snapshots dereferenced** ([#789](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/789)). Counts of `unsafe` blocks, lock sites, etc. now point at the live CI verifier output instead of being hand-edited per release.
- **`CONTRIBUTING.md` quickstart fixed** ([#787](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/787)): leaked WSL local path removed, placeholder clone URL replaced with the real `cyberlife-coder/VelesDB` URL.
- **Maintainer-local author config gitignored** ([#786](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/786)). It no longer surfaces in the public repo.
- **Roadmap consolidated** ([#792](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/792), closes [#689](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/issues/689)). Hardware-accelerator backlog (GPU expansion beyond CUDA, FPGA exploration, Apple Neural Engine) collapsed into a single Horizon-3 entry with measurable decision criteria.

### Fixed

- **All `unsafe` blocks now satisfy `verify_unsafe_safety_template.py --strict`** ([#790](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/790)). 15 SAFETY templates across 8 files completed: `// SAFETY:` headline, `// - bullet` invariant list, `// Reason:` paragraph (or a second `// SAFETY:` block). Gate 4 of `QUALITY_BAR.md` now enforced in strict mode.
- **ESLint 10 + sparseSearchNamed + CBO feedback + HNSW reorder fixes** ([#783](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/783), supersedes [#782](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/782)). Combined remediation PR for the post-v1.14.4 audit findings on the TS SDK and core query-cost path.
- **`LET` execution projection test docstring** ([#763](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/763)). Corrected an overclaiming comment that did not match the test's actual coverage.

### Performance

- **HNSW: auto-reorder on `ANALYZE`** ([#785](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/785), closes [#377](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/issues/377)). `ANALYZE <collection>` now triggers an in-place HNSW node reordering if fragmentation exceeds threshold; the 10K probe-boundary off-by-one that caused recall@10 to dip below 0.95 on the upper bound of the local-recall gate is fixed.
- **`IN` filter: O(log n) binary search for large value sets** ([#765](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/765), closes [#512](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/issues/512)). Switching from linear scan to sorted-vec + `binary_search` removes the O(n·m) cliff on `WHERE x IN (...)` clauses with hundreds of values.

### CI / Tooling

- **Bumped GitHub Actions versions**: `actions/checkout 5 → 6` ([#751](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/751)), `actions/setup-node 6.3 → 6.4` ([#767](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/767)), `Swatinem/rust-cache 2.8.2 → 2.9.1` ([#769](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/769)), `softprops/action-gh-release 2.2 → 3.0` ([#771](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/771)), `pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish 1.12 → 1.14` ([#749](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/749)).
- **CLA Assistant: automation bot added to signed contributors** ([12931cec](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/commit/12931cec)) — unblocks future automated review comments.
- **`examples/react-wasm-search` Vite 7.3 + esbuild CVE remediation** ([#800](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/800)). Closes the moderate `GHSA-67mh-4wv8-2f99` esbuild dev-server CVE on the example toolchain; dropped the unused `vite-plugin-top-level-await` plugin (-30% bundle size). Supersedes Dependabot's [#798](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/798) / [#799](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/799) (Vite 8 incompatible with `@vitejs/plugin-react` v4).

### Refactor

- **CboFeedbackLoop is now `pub(crate)`** — see *Changed* above ([#791](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/791)).

### Notes on Migration

This release is **drop-in for every public API**. The only user-observable changes are additive (new opt-in features). Internal refactors (`CboFeedbackLoop` visibility, `rand 0.10` trait migration, `getrandom 0.4` dual-version declaration) are absorbed inside the workspace and do not surface to SDK users.

If you depend on `velesdb-core` directly as a Rust library AND you used the (always-unintended) public access to `CboFeedbackLoop`, vendor the file or open an issue describing your use case — the type is feedback-loop internal and not part of the planned public surface.

## [1.14.4] — 2026-05-01

### Summary

Pre-seed audit hygiene patch. No new feature, no breaking change — narrative is *"discipline + audit-readiness before the VC pitch deck"*. Closes one runtime bug (flaky streaming test #724), disambiguates a perf claim ambiguity that could have been read as misleading by a careful VC scrutiny, expands the PyPI wheel matrix to include macOS Intel, and codifies four documentation/tooling gaps surfaced during the v1.14.4 pre-tag audit (KNOWN_LIMITATIONS for `velesdb-migrate`, TS SDK Node compat table, full RUSTSEC inventory in `.cargo/audit.toml`, factually-correct README perf footnotes with promise-contract policing).

### Fixed

- **Flaky `test_stream_searchable_immediately` deflaked** — Replaced the brittle `thread::sleep(25ms)` + post-loop search pattern with a single 500ms polling loop on `search()` and a firm deadline assertion. 10/10 PASS verified locally; closes #724. ([#735](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/735))

### Changed

- **`requires-python` raised from `>=3.9` to `>=3.10`** on all three Python RAG framework integrations (`haystack-velesdb`, `langchain-velesdb`, `llama-index-vector-stores-velesdb`) and their shared `velesdb-common` runtime helpers. Python 3.9 was advertised since the integrations were first published but never actually exercised — CI runs on 3.11 only, and each integration's core dep (`haystack-ai>=2.28.0`, `langchain-core>=1.0`, `llama-index-core>=0.14`) already requires `>=3.10` in its latest version. The previous floor would have silently resolved on Python 3.9 to a stale core package that lacks the API surface our connectors call into. Aligned `Programming Language :: Python :: 3.x` PyPI classifiers (3.9 row dropped). Bumped the runtime `velesdb` and `velesdb-common` dep floors from `>=1.12.0` to `>=1.14.0` (the integrations' filter translation + payload schema have evolved since 1.12). `integrations/README.md` now documents the explicit supported-Python matrix. ([#734](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/734))
- **README perf claims disambiguated**: the index-only micro-benchmark (55µs) and the canonical end-to-end number (450µs p50, 10K/384D, recall ≥ 96%) are now visually segregated with explicit qualifiers, eliminating the risk of a casual read confusing the two. Added 4 new claims to `docs/reference/promise-contract.json` (`readme_simd_cosine_latency`, `readme_simd_euclidean_latency`, `readme_simd_dot_product_per_metric_latency`, `readme_columnstore_speedup_baseline_rows`); the verifier now polices 19 claims (was 15). ([#736](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/736))
- **Test fixture diagnostics strengthened** on 4 user-facing crates (`velesdb-server` lib + config, `velesdb-python` utils, `velesdb-mobile` agent). 67 `.unwrap()` calls inside `#[cfg(test)] mod tests` blocks were converted to `.expect("test: <reason>")` with documented rationale. **Important factual note**: this does NOT reduce production unwrap debt — all 67 were already in test code (where `.unwrap()` is permitted by `rust-safety.md`). The pre-seed audit P1 #4 finding that cited "unwrap debt on 4 user-facing files" did not distinguish test from production scope; the actual production unwrap surface (~333 calls workspace-wide, concentrated in `collection/graph_collection.rs`, `velesdb-wasm/src/velesql.rs`, `parser/helpers.rs`, etc.) is scheduled for a separate, properly scoped PR. ([#737](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/737))
- **Documented `velesdb-migrate` (12,108 LOC, 9 connectors) as scheduled for rework decision in v1.15.0**. New entry in `docs/reference/KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md` § 4 plus matching item in `ROADMAP.md` Horizon 2 with measurable decision criteria (crates.io download counts, GitHub stars, opened issues count). No behavior change in v1.14.x — pure forward-looking transparency note. ([#739](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/739))
- **TypeScript SDK README now documents the supported Node.js matrix** (18/20/22 LTS), mirroring the Python integration matrices added in the v1.14.3 line. Captures the v1.13.7 Node.js WASM init fix (`fs.readFile` instead of broken `fetch('file://')`) so users land on the working entry point. ([#740](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/740))
- **`.cargo/audit.toml` enriched with full RUSTSEC inventory** (22 advisories with one-line rationale per entry, grouped by category — Tauri 1.x→2.x GTK3 family, HTML/CSS parsing chain, maintenance-only churn, `unic-*` family). Brings local `cargo audit` parity with the CI gate already enforced through `deny.toml` + `cargo-deny check advisories`. CI behavior unchanged — purely a developer-experience fix that eliminates noise when contributors run `cargo audit` locally. ([#741](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/741))

### Added

- **macOS Intel (x86_64) PyPI wheel** via `macos-13` runner in the `publish-pypi-wheels` matrix of `release.yml`. Brings the wheel count from 4 (linux x86_64, linux aarch64, macos arm64, windows x64) to **5** (+ macos x86_64). Eliminates the "build from source" friction for Intel Mac users. Validation deferred to this release run — `pypi.org/pypi/velesdb/1.14.4/json` must list `macosx_*_x86_64.whl`. ([#738](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/738))

## [1.14.3] — 2026-05-01

### Summary

Quality-of-life + correctness patch closing the post-v1.14.2 audit. Two **runtime user-blocking bugs** in the Haystack integration (`@component` decorator missing on the example retriever; `filter_documents` and `embedding_retrieval` did not translate Haystack 2.x filters to the VelesDB native shape, so any user-passed filter silently failed against the real backend), one **fictional Windows MSI installer documented since v1.0.0** removed from `docs/guides/INSTALLATION.md`, and a wide doc/version drift sweep that the existing tooling did not yet police. New CI safeguards + extended bumper/verifier so the same gap class cannot recur.

### Fixed

- **Haystack `Pipeline` retriever example was runtime-broken** ([`integrations/haystack/examples/rag_pipeline.py`](integrations/haystack/examples/rag_pipeline.py)). The shipped `_VelesRetriever` class had no `@component` decorator. Haystack 2.x's `Pipeline.add_component()` rejects undecorated classes with `PipelineError`, so anyone running the example file hit the wall before reaching their first search. Fixed by adding `@component` + `@component.output_types(documents=List[Document])` and renaming `_VelesRetriever` → `VelesRetriever` to match the canonical pattern already documented in the README. A new CI **AST validation step** rejects any future PR adding a `*Retriever` class without `@component` ([`.github/workflows/propagation-guard.yml`](.github/workflows/propagation-guard.yml)).
- **Haystack filter API silently failed against real VelesDB** ([`integrations/haystack/src/haystack_velesdb/document_store.py`](integrations/haystack/src/haystack_velesdb/document_store.py)). `filter_documents()` and `embedding_retrieval()` forwarded the Haystack 2.x filter dict (`{"operator": "AND", "conditions": [{"field": "meta.x", "operator": "==", "value": v}]}`) straight to `Collection.scroll(filter=...)` and `Collection.search(filter=...)`. VelesDB's native shape is `{"condition": {"type": "and", "conditions": [{"type": "eq", "field": "x", "value": v}]}}` — completely incompatible. Real users got either `ValueError: Invalid filter: missing field 'condition'` or empty results silently. The stub-based unit suite did not catch this because the fake `scroll()` ignored the filter argument. New `_translate_haystack_filter()` (recursive on AND/OR/NOT trees, strips `meta.` prefix, maps `==/!=/>/>=/</<= → eq/neq/gt/gte/lt/lte`, `in/not in → in/not(in)`, raises `NotImplementedError` for unsupported operators and `ValueError` for malformed filters). Wired into both methods. **+18 unit tests** + a new **Haystack Real Integration CI job** that installs `haystack-ai` + the published `velesdb` wheel and exercises the suite end-to-end ([`integrations/haystack/tests/test_real_haystack_integration.py`](integrations/haystack/tests/test_real_haystack_integration.py)).
- **Critical user-blocker — `docs/guides/INSTALLATION.md` advertised a Windows MSI installer that has never been published** ([`docs/guides/INSTALLATION.md`](docs/guides/INSTALLATION.md)). The "MSI Installer (Recommended)" section, four `msiexec` examples, and the `.msi` row in the Available Packages table all referenced a `velesdb-x.x.x-x86_64.msi` artifact that no GitHub release has ever produced (verified via `gh release view`: only `.zip`, `.deb`, `.tar.gz` ship). Replaced with a portable `.zip` walkthrough using the real artifact name (`velesdb-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.zip`). Also fixed the Linux portable tarball URL (was `velesdb-linux-x86_64.tar.gz` — would have 404'd; real name `velesdb-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz`) and added macOS rows to the table.
- **Doc version banners drifting at v1.13.0 / v1.14.0** while workspace was already v1.14.2: `docs/guides/CLI_REPL.md` (5 occurrences across header + sample outputs + table), `docs/guides/CONFIGURATION.md`, `docs/guides/GRAPH_PATTERNS.md`, `docs/guides/SEARCH_MODES.md`, `docs/guides/AGENT_MEMORY.md` (was `1.9.1`!), `docs/BENCHMARKS.md`, `docs/reference/ECOSYSTEM_PARITY.md`, `docs/reference/VELESQL_CONFORMANCE_MATRIX.md`, `docs/reference/ARCHITECTURE_DIAGRAMS.md`, `ROADMAP.md` (`covers v1.14.0 (current)` → `v1.14.3`), `sdks/typescript/README.md` (npmjs.com banner).
- **Integration `__version__` drift** — `langchain_velesdb.__version__` and `llamaindex_velesdb.__version__` were both stuck at `"1.13.0"` while the published wheels were already at `1.14.2`. The two existing `test_version_is_current` cases hardcoded `"1.13.0"` and would have stayed broken silently — they are now rewritten to compare against `importlib.metadata.version()` so they self-heal on every future release.
- **Haystack pyproject minimum-version floor** raised from `velesdb>=1.13.2` / `velesdb-common>=1.13.2` to `>=1.14.0` — the integration was first published in v1.14.0, so the older floor was misleading (and never actually tested).
- **Other drift fixed**: `docs/openapi.yaml` was at `1.13.1` (the JSON variant has been policed since v1.14.0 but the YAML wasn't), `examples/wasm-browser-demo/README.md` had two CDN URL examples at `@1.14.0` while `index.html` was already at `@1.14.2`, `scripts/dx-timing/scenario_rust.sh` and `scenario_server.sh` were still pinned to `velesdb-(core|server)@1.13.7` per the v1.13.8 deferred follow-up note.

### Added

- **CI: `Haystack Real Integration` job** ([`.github/workflows/propagation-guard.yml`](.github/workflows/propagation-guard.yml)). Installs `velesdb>=1.14.0` + `haystack-ai>=2.0.0` and runs `tests/test_real_haystack_integration.py` end-to-end (real `Document` round-trip, filter translator against a real `velesdb.Database`, `DuplicatePolicy.SKIP` regression, real `Pipeline` + decorated `VelesRetriever`). The only place protocol drift between the connector and the actual Haystack 2.x runtime can be caught — the existing unit suite uses stubs.
- **CI: AST validation that every `*Retriever` class in `rag_pipeline.py` carries `@component`**. Static check runs in `Python Integrations Check`; PRs that introduce an undecorated retriever fail fast with an explicit `::error` annotation.
- **CI: `py_compile` smoke for `integrations/haystack/examples/rag_pipeline.py`** in the existing `Demos and Examples Smoke` job — the bare minimum that the file users copy-paste won't break on a syntax error.

### Changed

- **`scripts/bump-version.ps1` and `scripts/check-version-sync.py` extended with 14 new entries + 6 new readers** so every drift listed in the v1.14.2 audit is auto-rewritten on the next release and verified by the gate. New readers: `yaml_openapi`, `ts_sdk_banner`, `roadmap_current`, `doc_guide_version_header`, `doc_last_updated_version`, `md_title_version`, `cargo_pin`. Total tracked: **37 checks across 36 unique files** in the verifier (was 22) — `docs/guides/CONFIGURATION.md` is now checked by two readers (TOML code-block header + markdown banner) since the file carries both. Bumper covers **35 manifests + Cargo workspace** (was 22). Both gates idempotent at v1.14.3 (`bump-version.ps1 -Version 1.14.3 -DryRun` reports `0 file(s) would be updated`). The `TARGETS` data structure in `check-version-sync.py` was changed from a `dict` to a list of `(path, format)` tuples — Devin caught a duplicate-key bug on the first revision where Python silently dropped the second `CONFIGURATION.md` entry, killing the TOML-header check; the list-of-tuples form makes per-file multi-reader coverage explicit and unambiguous.
- **`scripts/check-version-sync.py` README-banner gap closed** (PR #728). Earlier post-v1.14.2 audit caught that `crates/velesdb-server/README.md` and `crates/velesdb-python/README.md` were tracked by `bump-version.ps1` but not by the verifier. Two new readers added (`doc_health_snippet` reused for the server README, new `doc_version_badge` for the Python README's shields.io banner). The two scripts still differ on two intentional entries (`sdks/typescript/package-lock.json` is only in the verifier — `npm install` regenerates it from `package.json`; `crates/velesdb-wasm/pkg/package.json` is only in the bumper — `wasm-pack build` regenerates it on every release), but the manually-tracked set now matches.
- **`CONTRIBUTING.md` release recipe target count** updated from `17` (stale since v1.14.0) to `37 checks must align`. The CHANGELOG entry for v1.14.2 (which incorrectly claimed "21 targets") was corrected in the same PR.
- **Release checklist extended** with a new "Pre-Tag — MANDATORY Factual & Zero-Friction Audit" section (4 piliers: factualité, zero-friction, standards, vérification automatisée). Codifies the user-empathy audit that found the MSI fiction, the `__version__` constants drift, and the 11 doc banner stamps. Triggered automatically on every release request via the new `feedback_release_zero_friction_factual.md` memory entry.

## [1.14.2] — 2026-05-01

### Summary

Quality-of-life patch closing the Devin findings on PR #722 (doc consistency sweep) and PR #723 (Haystack publish-pipeline fix). One real Haystack contract bug (`DuplicatePolicy.SKIP` was silently overwriting), seven version-drift gaps that the existing tooling didn't yet police, and the ROADMAP horizon body that was left contradicting its own heading.

### Fixed

- **Haystack `DuplicatePolicy.SKIP` now honours the contract** ([`integrations/haystack/src/haystack_velesdb/document_store.py`](integrations/haystack/src/haystack_velesdb/document_store.py)). Earlier behaviour fell through to `col.upsert(points)` for every policy except `FAIL`, so passing `SKIP` silently overwrote existing documents — a violation of the Haystack `DocumentStore` contract that other implementations (e.g. `InMemoryDocumentStore`) honour. Now: `SKIP` filters the incoming batch via point-by-point `col.get(int_ids)` and only upserts the genuinely-new subset; the return value reflects the count actually written. Two regression tests added (`test_write_documents_skip_policy_does_not_overwrite_existing`, `test_write_documents_skip_policy_all_existing_returns_zero`).
- **`haystack_velesdb.__version__` now tracks the workspace** (`integrations/haystack/src/haystack_velesdb/__init__.py`). Was hardcoded at `1.0.0` from the contributor's initial draft; users calling `haystack_velesdb.__version__` saw `1.0.0` while `pip show haystack-velesdb` showed `1.14.1`. Bumped to `1.14.2` and now tracked by `bump-version.ps1` + `check-version-sync.py` (new `py_init_version` reader type).
- **Browser demo CDN URLs aligned** ([`examples/wasm-browser-demo/index.html`](examples/wasm-browser-demo/index.html)). Two `unpkg`/`jsdelivr` URLs were pinned at `velesdb-wasm@1.7.0` (un-scoped, seven minors stale) — the demo was loading a wasm module that did not match the workspace at all. Now `@wiscale/velesdb-wasm@1.14.2` and tracked by the bump script (new `wasm_cdn_url` reader type).
- **Hardcoded version banners** in `crates/velesdb-server/README.md` health JSON examples and `crates/velesdb-python/README.md` shields badge now tracked by `bump-version.ps1`. Both were drifting at `1.14.0` while workspace was `1.14.1`.
- **`docs/guides/CONFIGURATION.md` TOML example header** (`# Version: 1.13.0`) was missed by the v1.14.0 doc consistency sweep because it lived inside a code block. Now tracked (new `doc_toml_header` reader type).
- **`ROADMAP.md` Horizon 1 body** brought into sync with its heading. The heading was bumped to `v1.14.x → v1.15.0` in PR #722 but the body still listed Haystack as `In review (PR #672)`, the milestone link as `v1.14.0`, and patch releases as `v1.13.3+`. Body now reflects the shipped state (Haystack in v1.14.0/v1.14.1, items 3-5 marked Open and slated for v1.15.0).
- **`docs/reference/ECOSYSTEM_PARITY.md` enum tables** now include the Haystack column (the v1.14.0 sweep added it to the main 22-row matrix but missed the `DistanceMetric`, `StorageMode`, `FusionStrategy`, `SearchQuality`, and `CollectionType` per-enum tables). Coverage labels updated from `9/9` to `10/10` where applicable; `CollectionType` shows Haystack as `1/3` (only `Vector` maps idiomatically through the `DocumentStore` protocol).

### Changed

- **`scripts/bump-version.ps1` now polices 22 manifests** (was 17 in v1.14.0, 18 in v1.14.1). The 4 new entries (`integrations/haystack/__init__.py`, `examples/wasm-browser-demo/index.html`, `docs/guides/CONFIGURATION.md`, `crates/velesdb-server/README.md` + `crates/velesdb-python/README.md`) close the version-drift gaps Devin found in this round. Note: `scripts/check-version-sync.py` was only updated to 20 entries in v1.14.2 — the 2-entry asymmetry against `bump-version.ps1` (22) was caught by Devin on PR #726/#727 and closed in PR #728 (see Unreleased).

## [1.14.1] — 2026-04-30

### Summary

Pipeline-fix patch release. v1.14.0 added the Haystack 2.x DocumentStore source code (PR #672) but the release workflow forgot to publish `haystack-velesdb` to PyPI, so `pip install haystack-velesdb` returned 404 even though the README and `integrations/README.md` directed users to it. v1.14.1 closes that gap.

### Fixed

- **`haystack-velesdb` now published to PyPI** ([release.yml](.github/workflows/release.yml)). Added the package to the `publish-pypi-pure` matrix alongside `langchain-velesdb` and `llamaindex-velesdb`. The trio of Python RAG framework connectors is now actually installable from PyPI.
- **`integrations/haystack/pyproject.toml` version aligned with the workspace**. Was pinned at `1.0.0` from contributor's initial draft; now lock-step with workspace at `1.14.1` and tracked by `bump-version.ps1` + `check-version-sync.py` (one extra target → 18 total).

### Added

- **Haystack 2.x DocumentStore connector** (`integrations/haystack/`) — first-party `VelesDBDocumentStore` implementing the Haystack `DocumentStore` protocol (`write_documents`, `filter_documents`, `embedding_retrieval`, `count_documents`, `delete_documents`). Closes [#349](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/issues/349). Together with the existing `langchain-velesdb` and `llamaindex-velesdb` connectors, VelesDB now ships first-party support for the three major Python RAG frameworks. Contributed by [@CrepuscularIRIS](https://github.com/CrepuscularIRIS) ([#672](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/672)).
- **`integrations/README.md`** — landing page documenting the Python RAG framework parity, shared `velesdb-common` building blocks, and per-framework feature support matrix.

### Changed

- `docs/reference/ECOSYSTEM_PARITY.md` — Haystack integration column added to the 22-row parity matrix and to the action-items list.
- Root `README.md` — Haystack integration added to the ecosystem table; explicit "Python RAG framework parity" callout below the table; v1.14.0 row added to Roadmap.

### Documentation (consistency sweep — post-v1.14.0)

- **Version stamps aligned to v1.14.0** across `docs/BENCHMARKS.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `QUALITY_BAR.md`, `docs/VELESQL_SPEC.md`, `docs/reference/VELESQL_CONFORMANCE_MATRIX.md`, `docs/reference/ARCHITECTURE_DIAGRAMS.md`, `docs/guides/CONFIGURATION.md`, `docs/guides/GRAPH_PATTERNS.md`, `docs/guides/SEARCH_MODES.md`, `crates/velesdb-python/README.md`, `sdks/typescript/README.md`.
- **Cargo dep examples fixed**: `docs/GPU_ACCELERATION.md` (1.11→1.14), `docs/guides/tutorials/MINI_RECOMMENDER.md` (1.11→1.14), `docs/reference/NATIVE_HNSW.md` (1.0→1.14), `docs/guides/INSTALLATION.md` (1.13→1.14).
- **Server health JSON snippets** restored to `1.14.0` in `crates/velesdb-server/README.md`.
- **CDN URLs**: `examples/wasm-browser-demo/README.md` updated to `@wiscale/velesdb-wasm@1.14.0` (npm scope rename + version bump).
- **`docs/guides/INSTALLATION.md`**: 9 hardcoded `v1.13.0` download URLs replaced with `v1.14.0`.
- **Integrations**: `integrations/common/README.md` now lists all three (LangChain + LlamaIndex + Haystack) consumers; `integrations/README.md` uses the canonical PyPI name `llama-index-vector-stores-velesdb`.
- **Examples index** (`examples/README.md`): Haystack example pointer added.
- **`CONTRIBUTORS.md`**: PR #672 stamped with v1.14.0; lowercase `velesdb/pull` URLs corrected to capital `VelesDB/pull`.
- **`crates/velesdb-{core,server}/README.md`**: License badge URLs corrected to capital `cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/`.
- **`CONTRIBUTING.md`**: "Publishing a release" snippet rewritten to reflect the actual v1.14.0 release flow (`bump-version.ps1` + `check-version-sync.py` + tag-after-CI-success rule).
- **TS SDK `README.md`**: "What's New" sections added for v1.14.0 (MSRV) and v1.13.7 (Node WASM init fix), so the changelog narrative no longer skips four releases.

### Pending milestone (v1.15.0)

- [#429](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/issues/429) Python DataFrame, [#469](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/issues/469) CBO calibration, [#717](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/issues/717) PyO3 SearchOptions builder.

## [1.14.0] — 2026-04-30

### Summary

DX correctness & release-pipeline hygiene minor release. Closes the two remaining honesty notes from the Phase 6 onboarding harness ([#379](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/issues/379)): the workspace `rust-version` field now matches what the SIMD path actually requires, and Docker `LABEL version` lines no longer drift between releases.

### Changed

- **MSRV bumped to Rust 1.89** ([#714](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/714)). Workspace `Cargo.toml`, `.clippy.toml`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, examples READMEs, and CI workflows now all declare 1.89 as the minimum supported toolchain. The previous `1.83` claim was inaccurate from day one: `crates/velesdb-core/src/simd_native/x86_avx512.rs` uses `#[target_feature(enable = "avx512vpopcntdq")]`, a target feature stabilised only in Rust 1.89 — so builds on toolchains 1.83–1.88 were already failing silently with hundreds of errors. This corrects the manifest to match reality and pulls the CI environment forward to the same minimum. Resolves the `#2` honesty note in [`docs/quickstart/timing-results.md`](docs/quickstart/timing-results.md).
- **Docker `LABEL version` lines are now auto-synced with the workspace version** ([#715](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/715)). The root `Dockerfile` shipped a stale `LABEL version="1.12.0"` across seven patch releases (v1.12.1 → v1.13.7) because no tooling touched it. `scripts/bump-version.ps1` now rewrites the `^LABEL version=` line on every release across `Dockerfile`, `benchmarks/Dockerfile.optimized`, `benchmarks/Dockerfile.nightly`, and `benchmarks/Dockerfile.bench`; `scripts/check-version-sync.py` fails fast if any of them drift. Resolves the `#3` honesty note in [`docs/quickstart/timing-results.md`](docs/quickstart/timing-results.md).

### Breaking change considerations

Bumping the workspace `rust-version` from 1.83 to 1.89 is a **minor release** per cargo MSRV conventions. Users on a stable Rust 1.83–1.88 toolchain are unaffected in practice because their builds were already failing on the SIMD path; this release simply makes the failure mode honest (`error: package velesdb-core requires rustc 1.89 or newer` from cargo's resolver) instead of producing 499 obscure target-feature errors.

### Tooling

- 17 tracked targets (10 manifests + OpenAPI + 3 doc snippets + 4 Dockerfile labels) are now lock-step bumped by `scripts/bump-version.ps1` and verified by `scripts/check-version-sync.py`. Future drift can no longer slip past CI.

### No-op for runtime consumers

- 450 µs p50 end-to-end search path preserved.
- crates.io / PyPI / npm artefacts are functionally identical to v1.13.8 — only the `rust-version` claim and Docker label metadata have changed.

## [1.13.8] — 2026-04-30

### Summary

Python DX patch release. Resolves the largest friction surfaced by the Phase 6 onboarding harness ([#379](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/issues/379)): `pip install velesdb` (without the `[numpy]` extra) crashed at first `import velesdb` because the published wheel did not declare `numpy` as a runtime dependency, even though the PyO3 bindings call the NumPy C API capsule at module load time.

### Fixed

- **Python wheel now declares `numpy>=1.20` as a hard runtime dependency** ([#713](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/713)). A single `pip install velesdb` is now sufficient. The `[numpy]` extra is preserved as a no-op alias so existing `requirements.txt` files that pin `velesdb[numpy]` keep working. Resolves the `#1` honesty note in [`docs/quickstart/timing-results.md`](docs/quickstart/timing-results.md).

### No-op for non-Python consumers

- Rust crates: no source change. Workspace version bumped from 1.13.7 to 1.13.8 to keep all manifests aligned (the release pipeline publishes them in lock-step).
- TypeScript SDK / WASM: no source change.
- 450 µs p50 end-to-end search path preserved.

### Known carry-over (closed in v1.14.0)

- `Cargo.toml#workspace.package.rust-version` still declares `1.83`, while `docs/getting-started.md` and `docs/quickstart/timing-results.md` advertise Rust 1.89+ as the actually-required toolchain (the SIMD path uses `avx512vpopcntdq` which only stabilised in 1.89). This 3-way inconsistency was already present in v1.13.7 — v1.13.8 does not fix or worsen it. The dedicated MSRV-bump PR is staged as v1.14.0 (see [#714](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/714)).
- `scripts/dx-timing/scenario_rust.sh` and `scenario_server.sh` still pin to `velesdb-core@1.13.7` / `velesdb-server@1.13.7`. They will be bumped to `@1.13.8` in a follow-up commit on `develop` once v1.13.8 is published to crates.io (the bump cannot land in this release branch — the version it pins must already exist in the registry).

## [1.13.7] — 2026-04-28

### Summary

TypeScript SDK patch release. Fixes a Node.js-specific bug discovered while
building the dx-timing onboarding scenarios for [#379](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/issues/379):
`new VelesDB({ backend: 'wasm' })` followed by `db.init()` crashed 100% of the
time in Node.js because wasm-pack's default initializer relies on
`fetch('file://...')`, which Node's stdlib `fetch` (undici) does not support.

The JSDoc on the public `VelesDB` class advertises *"WASM backend (browser/Node.js)"*,
so the crash was a real DX bug, not a documented limitation. v1.13.7 makes
that promise true.

### Fixed

- **TS SDK `WasmBackend.init()` now works in Node.js** ([#709](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/709)). When running under Node, the backend reads the `velesdb_wasm_bg.wasm` bytes from disk via `fs.readFile` and passes them to wasm-pack's initializer as an explicit `Uint8Array`, bypassing the broken `fetch('file://...')` path. Browsers keep the original fetch behaviour unchanged.
- **TS SDK lifecycle hardening** (same PR). `init()` is now race-free: a memoized in-flight promise coalesces concurrent callers into a single wasm-bindgen invocation, and `close()` bumps a generation counter so a still-running `runInit()` cannot flip `_initialized` back to `true` after the backend has been closed. `close()` also nulls out `wasmModule` so subsequent `init()` calls re-import cleanly.

### Changed

- TS SDK build now emits both ESM and CJS bundles that work end-to-end in Node.js. Verified with `node:20-slim` Docker container (smoke test in [#709](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/709)).
- TS SDK gains a new internal module `src/backends/wasm-node-loader.ts` that hosts the Node-only init helpers (`isNodeRuntime`, `loadWasmBytesNode`). Browser bundles never reach this file because `WasmBackend.init()` gates the import on the runtime detection.

### No-op for non-TS consumers

- Rust crates: no source change. Workspace version bumped from 1.13.6 to 1.13.7 to keep all manifests aligned (the release pipeline publishes them in lock-step).
- Python wheel: no source change.
- WASM artifact: no source change. The `@wiscale/velesdb-wasm` npm package is unchanged at 1.13.6 — the TS SDK consumes it via the same dependency range.
- 450 µs p50 end-to-end path preserved.

## [1.13.6] — 2026-04-28

### Summary

Devin findings batch fix-up release. Six concrete corrections derived from Devin Review comments on PRs #701/#702/#703/#704, plus release tooling hardening so the same class of issues cannot recur.

### Fixed

- **`integrations/common/pyproject.toml` version was stuck at 1.13.3** across v1.13.4 and v1.13.5 because `scripts/bump-version.ps1` did not include this file. The package was silently re-uploaded as `1.13.3` (already published) on PyPI, leaving consumers at the stale version. v1.13.6 bumps `velesdb-common` to 1.13.6, adds it to the bump script, and adds it to `scripts/check-version-sync.py` so future releases catch the gap.
- **`crates/velesdb-migrate` and `crates/velesdb-cli` declared `console = "0.15"` and `indicatif = "0.17"`** while `dialoguer 0.12` (newly bumped) pulls `console 0.16`. Two copies of `console` were being compiled. Bumped both to `console = "0.16"` direct + `indicatif = "0.18"` (which pulls `console 0.16`); `Cargo.lock` now lists a single `console 0.16.3` entry.
- **`sdks/typescript/package-lock.json` was stale at `1.13.3`** through v1.13.4 and v1.13.5 (not regenerated after each `package.json` bump). Regenerated via `npm install --package-lock-only`; lockfile root now reads `1.13.6`.
- **`CHANGELOG.md` link references covered only 0.x releases.** Added link references for `[1.13.0]` through `[1.13.6]` and updated `[Unreleased]` to compare against `v1.13.6`. Now matches the [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) format the file claims to follow.

### Tooling

- `scripts/bump-version.ps1` now bumps `integrations/common/pyproject.toml` (previously missed).
- `scripts/check-version-sync.py` now verifies `integrations/common/pyproject.toml` (previously missed).

### No-op

## [1.13.5] — 2026-04-28

### Summary

Fix-up patch release for v1.13.4. PyPI and npm packages were published successfully at `1.13.4`, but `cargo publish --locked` to `crates.io` failed because `Cargo.lock` was not regenerated after the version bump (lock file still listed crates at `1.13.3`). v1.13.5 ships the regenerated `Cargo.lock` so all eight workspace crates can be published to `crates.io` consistently with the npm/PyPI packages.

### Fixed

- **crates.io publishing**: `Cargo.lock` regenerated to match the workspace version, unblocking `cargo publish --locked` for all eight workspace crates ([#701](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/701) follow-up).

### No-op

- No source code change beyond `Cargo.lock` regeneration and version-string bumps from `1.13.4` to `1.13.5`.
- No public API change.
- No behavioural change in the canonical 450 µs p50 end-to-end path.

## [1.13.4] — 2026-04-27

### Summary

Strictly additive patch release. Two themes:

1. **Devin-flagged technical debt resolutions** — three follow-ups merged from the v1.13.3 review pass: LTO config canonical source, HNSW `search_batch_parallel` ef_search alignment, and the remaining `ef_search` call sites alignment.
2. **Dependency hygiene batch** — seven Dependabot bumps validated and merged (one upload-artifact GH Action, two npm dev deps, four cargo deps including `roaring 0.11.4` for upstream bugfixes and `sha2 0.11.0`).

This release is fully backward-compatible — no API breakage, no behavioural change in the canonical end-to-end performance path (450 µs p50 preserved).

### Fixed

- **HNSW batch search**: `HnswIndex::search_batch_parallel` now uses `ef_search_for_scale()` consistently with the single-search path, ensuring identical recall behaviour across batch and individual queries ([#698](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/698), closes [#695](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/issues/695)).
- **HNSW remaining call sites**: aligned all remaining `ef_search` invocations with `ef_search_for_scale` per Devin finding, completing the consistency pass started in v1.13.3 ([#700](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/700), closes [#699](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/issues/699)).

### Changed

- **Build profile**: `Cargo.toml` is now the authoritative source for `[profile.release]` and `[profile.bench]` — removed duplicate definitions from per-crate manifests that could drift ([#697](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/697), closes [#694](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/issues/694)).

### Dependencies

- **cargo**: `roaring 0.10.12 → 0.11.4` (upstream bugfixes: 32-bit overflow, `advance_back_to` invariant, vector sub zeros) ([#684](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/684)).
- **cargo**: `sha2 0.10.9 → 0.11.0` (RustCrypto major; usage limited to standard `Sha256` Digest API, no breakage) ([#682](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/682)).
- **cargo**: `indexmap 2.13.0 → 2.14.0` ([#687](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/687)).
- **cargo**: `dialoguer 0.11.0 → 0.12.0` ([#686](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/686)).
- **npm (dev)**: `@vitest/coverage-v8 4.0.16 → 4.1.5` ([#681](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/681)).
- **npm (dev)**: `@types/node 20.19.27 → 25.6.0` ([#679](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/679)).
- **GitHub Actions**: `actions/upload-artifact 6.0.0 → 7.0.1` ([#678](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/678)).

### No-op

- No public API change.
- No behavioural change in the canonical 450 µs p50 end-to-end path.
- No SemVer breakage. Workspace SDK versions (Rust crates, Python wheel, npm SDK) all bumped to `1.13.4`.

## [1.13.3] — 2026-04-27

### Summary

Strictly additive patch release. Two themes:

1. **Operational excellence pack** — three new top-level documents (`ARCHITECTURE.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `QUALITY_BAR.md`) and a clarified README to make the project's discipline visible in technical due diligence. No code changes for this theme.
2. **Internal feature additions** — Python Pythonic protocols (`__contains__`, context manager, `close()`), TypedDict return-type stubs, CBO `indexed_fields` cardinality wiring, HNSW `search_with_quality` alignment, WASM getrandom 0.3 fix, and the `rand 0.8 -> 0.9` migration.

This release is fully backward-compatible — no API breakage, no behavioural change in the canonical end-to-end performance path (450 µs p50 preserved).

### Added

- **`ARCHITECTURE.md`** at repo root (15-minute narrative gateway): TL;DR, three engines, layered diagram, crate map, anatomy of a query walkthrough, concurrency model, storage on disk, what's NOT in scope, soundness summary, canonical 450 µs perf number disambiguation ([#692](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/692)).
- **`ROADMAP.md`** at repo root: 3/6/12-month horizons with explicit OKRs, governance section, hierarchy of decisions ([#690](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/690)).
- **`QUALITY_BAR.md`** at repo root: seven non-negotiable shipping gates (recall, latency, unwrap, unsafe, cyclomatic, NLOC, duplication) with enforcement scripts referenced ([#691](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/691)).
- **GitHub milestone v1.14.0** with four focused issues (#349 Haystack, #379 DX, #469 CBO calibration, #429 Python DataFrame).
- **Python**: Pythonic protocols `__contains__`, context manager (`with db:`), `close()` on `Database` and collection types ([#426](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/426)).
- **Python**: TypedDict return-type stubs and complete `PyGraphSchema` stub for IDE completion and `mypy` ([#428](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/428)).
- **VelesQL CBO**: `indexed_fields` cardinality wiring for the cost estimator ([#607](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/607)).
- **CONTRIBUTORS.md**: contributor recognition, plus a CLA Assistant GitHub Action ([#676](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/676)).

### Changed

- **README.md**: top navigation bar now links to `ARCHITECTURE.md` / `ROADMAP.md` / `QUALITY_BAR.md`. The "Why VelesDB?" comparison table now uses the canonical 450 µs end-to-end number (replacing the 55 µs index-only micro-benchmark that was juxtaposed with the end-to-end number, creating a small ambiguity flagged in the 2026-04-27 pre-seed audit). The "System Benchmarks" deep-dive table is now explicitly labeled *Index-only micro-benchmarks* with a headline pointing back to the canonical 450 µs number ([#688](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/688)).
- **`crates/velesdb-core/README.md`**: same disambiguation pattern applied.
- **`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`**: clarifying banner stating it's a tech-debt registry, not the architecture overview, with explicit pointer to the new top-level `ARCHITECTURE.md`.
- **`docs/reference/promise-contract.json`**: `must_contain` substrings updated to match the disambiguated wording.
- **`CONTRIBUTING.md`**: Release Process section translated from French to English for consistency.
- **HNSW**: `NativeHnswIndex::search_with_quality` aligned with `ef_search_for_scale` ([#639](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/639)).
- **velesdb-server**: deduplicated batch search response building ([#453](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/453)).
- **velesdb-python**: `storage_mode` returns canonical names matching the core enum ([PR #674](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/674)).

### Fixed

- **WASM**: configure `getrandom 0.3` for `wasm32` after `rand 0.9` migration ([#645](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/645)).
- **velesdb-python**: dot metric test correctness.

### Dependencies

- Migrate `rand 0.8 -> 0.9` workspace-wide ([#645](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/645)).
- Bump `postcss` `8.5.6 -> 8.5.12` in `sdks/typescript` ([#675](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/675)).

### Documentation

- New Python `upsert_bulk_numpy()` performance best-practices guide ([#409](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/409)).

### Internal

- Closed seven SIMD/GPU roadmap issues (#498, #499, #500, #501, #503, #504, #505) into a single tracking issue [#689 — Hardware accelerator backlog (deferred)](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/issues/689), reducing the visible roadmap from 21 to 15 issues to make focus visible to investors and to the community.

### Migration notes

No migration needed. All changes are additive.

## [1.13.2] — 2026-04-25

### Summary

Strictly additive patch release shipping the observability + ops
endpoints work landed in [#648](https://github.com/cyberlife-coder/VelesDB/pull/648),
together with two routine dependabot bumps and one breaking-API
restoration to keep the v1.13.x series fully backward-compatible.

### Added

- **REST**: `POST /collections/{name}/points/delete` — bulk delete by
  ID (max 10000 per batch). Idempotent: empty `ids: []` is a no-op
  (200), unknown IDs are silently skipped.
- **REST**: `POST /collections/{name}/vacuum` — explicit alias of
  `/index/rebuild` exposed under a maintenance-oriented name.
- **REST**: `POST /collections/{name}/compact` — storage compaction;
  rewrites active vectors into a contiguous layout and reports
  `bytes_reclaimed`.
- **Prometheus**: 32 new time-series exposed via `/metrics` —
  `OperationalMetrics`, `GuardRailsMetrics`, `TraversalMetrics`,
  `DurationHistogram` (8-bucket query latency).
- **Core**: `VectorCollection::compact_storage()` and
  `Collection::compact_vector_storage()` public functions.
- **Tests**: `crates/velesdb-server/tests/admin_endpoints_bdd_tests.rs`
  with 13 nominal + edge + negative scenarios covering the three new
  endpoints and the delete -> vacuum -> compact lifecycle (mandatory
  per the project BDD testing conventions).

### Changed

- **Naming**: `OperationalMetrics::shared()` is now an additive
  forwarding alias of the new `OperationalMetrics::new_arc()`. The
  rename improves API honesty (every call returns a fresh `Arc`,
  not a shared singleton). The `shared()` symbol stays — marked
  `#[deprecated(since = "1.13.2")]` — so v1.13.x consumers continue
  to compile without changes.

### Dependencies

- Bump `rand` `0.8.5 -> 0.8.6` in `examples/rust` (GHSA security
  advisory).
- Bump `postcss` `8.5.6 -> 8.5.10` in `demos/tauri-rag-app`
  (CVE-2024-XXX dev-dep).

### CI

- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` `python-integrations` job: build the
  wheel from source via `pip install crates/velesdb-python` (PEP 517
  / maturin backend), now possible thanks to the `abi3-py39` feature
  added in v1.13.1.

## [1.13.1] — 2026-04-25

### Summary

Patch release closing the v1.13.0 release-cut CI debt. Adds the
`abi3-py39` feature to the `pyo3` dependency in `velesdb-python` so the
Python wheel can be built from source on standard CI runners without the
interpreter-discovery dance that took 9 hotfix iterations (#649-#657)
to bypass at the v1.13.0 tag. The `python-integrations` CI job, which
was temporarily disabled in #658 to unblock the v1.13.0 tag push, is
restored to its original guard. Future `develop -> main` release
cycles therefore exercise the integration tests end-to-end again.

The `abi3-py39` feature also reduces the per-Python-version wheel
matrix to a single ABI-stable wheel (Python 3.9+) rather than one wheel
per minor version. Same source code, same behaviour, smaller release
footprint.

### Changed

- `crates/velesdb-python/Cargo.toml` — pyo3 features now include
  `abi3-py39` alongside `extension-module` and `multiple-pymethods`.
  The published wheel is `cp39-abi3-...` instead of `cp310-cp310-...`
  / `cp311-cp311-...`. Functionally identical from Python users' point
  of view; the wheel is just compatible with a wider range of Python
  versions in one binary.
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — `python-integrations` job re-enabled
  with its original `if: github.event_name == 'push' && github.ref ==
  'refs/heads/main'` guard.

### Fixed

- The `develop -> main` release CI cycle no longer requires a wheel
  to be already on PyPI for the integration test job to pass. The
  abi3 wheel builds from source on the runner without a venv, which
  was the chicken-and-egg the v1.13.0 release cut hit.

## [1.13.0] — 2026-04-23

### Summary

Sprint 4 Phase C wraps up the VelesQL WASM executor, raises the TypeScript
SDK test coverage to 94% (from the 80% threshold), lands the SIFT1M
standardized ANN benchmark (the de-facto cross-implementation recall
number used by every major ANN paper), and closes three ts-sdk
follow-ups (`prefer-const`, `streamInsert` payload parity, `trainPq`
validation). Pre-seed credibility audit: the README now carries
reproducer commands next to every performance claim, a dedicated
"Known Limitations" section for scope transparency, and a refreshed
test-count badge (7634 tests across Rust, TypeScript, Python).

**GPU-accelerated HNSW layer-0 traversal** (`#626`, closes `#502`) —
new SONG 3-stage compute pipeline (Expand → Distance → Select) runs
layer-0 BFS on the GPU via wgpu compute shaders. CPU still handles
upper-layer greedy descent; the GPU kicks in only when
`num_vectors > 500_000` AND `num_vectors * dim ≤ u32::MAX` (WGSL has
no u64 — correctness gate). Graceful fallback to the CPU SIMD path
on any GPU error. 77 new GPU tests, zero new dependencies, zero
`unsafe`. Credit @SBALAVIGNESH123 for the original implementation.
Four same-day hardening PRs (`#637`, `#638`, `#640`, `#641`, tracked
under `#634`) close the remaining review findings: `search_auto`
wired into the production query pipeline (the GPU path was dormant
in the landed state of `#626`), explicit `LockRank` for
`gpu_vectors_snapshot` + a `debug_assert`-enforced caller contract
on `CsrCache::get_or_rebuild`, unified version counter for snapshot
+ CSR cache invalidation (closes the delete-then-insert-same-count
stale-serve class), and a CSR cache count-check cleanup that aligns
both caches on a single validity signal. Net: production-reachable,
statically-enforced, no hidden mutator-must-remember contracts.

**Pre-seed remediation (Option D)** — 10 phases merged across
`#611`–`#623`: BM25 persistence cold-start dropped from O(N) to O(1),
sparse search speed-up of 16× on 10K-doc corpora via k-way merge +
corpus-size-aware routing, HNSW search reduced by 12–22 % on the
sequential (< 10K) path through software prefetch plumbing, plus
significant duplication cleanup in the collection, HNSW, and vector
search layers (cumulative across all phases: jscpd `collection/`
84 → ~75 clones, `hnsw/` 19 → 9, `search/vector.rs` 14.31 % → 2.47 %).
Zero regression cumulatively —
recall gate (Fast 0.90 / Balanced 0.95 / Accurate 0.99 / Perfect 1.00)
passes on every phase.

### Added — VelesQL window functions

- **`ROW_NUMBER()`, `RANK()`, `DENSE_RANK()` with `OVER (PARTITION BY … ORDER BY …)`**
  (`#629`, closes `#386`). Credit @SBALAVIGNESH123 for the original
  implementation; the landed form includes a complete zero-tech-debt
  hardening pass.

  Grammar additions in `velesql/grammar.pest`: `window_item`,
  `window_function_call`, `over_clause`, `partition_by_clause`,
  `window_order_by_clause`. The evaluator lives in
  `velesql/window_evaluator.rs` and runs after DISTINCT and before
  ORDER BY / LIMIT in the query pipeline (see the design note on
  `apply_select_postprocessing` for why the order deviates from the SQL
  standard — vector-search survivors get a dense `1..N` numbering).

  Implementation highlights (all pinned by regression tests):

  - **Global snapshot-first evaluation** prevents three classes of
    payload corruption — intra-function (alias collides with own
    ORDER BY column), inter-function via ORDER BY, inter-function via
    PARTITION BY. `evaluate` pre-captures every window function's
    ORDER BY values and PARTITION BY keys **before** any injection,
    so sequential window evaluation cannot read another function's
    injected ranks.
  - **Dispatch-by-variant** for rank computation (`compute_row_numbers`,
    `compute_rank`, `compute_dense_rank`) with a shared `is_new_group`
    tie-detection predicate — no dead state.
  - **Canonical-JSON partition keys** preserve JSON type
    discriminators, eliminating collisions between `Number(1)` and
    `String("1")` and between `Null` and a literal payload string
    `"__null__"`.

### Changed — correctness fixes with visible effects

These corrections resolve pre-existing bugs that were silently wrong.
Each is pinned by regression tests; callers who depended on the buggy
output must update.

- **`SelectColumns::to_display_names` returns every SELECT-list item.**
  Previous releases silently dropped `similarity()` expressions and
  qualified wildcards from the Mixed SELECT variant, shortening the
  list returned by the Python `VelesQL.parse(...).columns` getter and
  the WASM `parsed.columns` getter. v1.13.0 returns the complete list
  in grammar order (columns → aggregations → similarity scores →
  qualified wildcards → window functions).

  *Migration*: callers that hard-coded an expected list length or
  `columns[n]` offsets against the buggy output will now see
  additional entries. Update the expected length / offsets, or
  switch to dict-style lookup by name. The complete contract is
  pinned by
  `velesql::ast_tests::test_display_names_mixed_includes_all_variants`.

- **`DISTINCT` dedup key now includes qualified-wildcard-expanded
  fields.** `SELECT DISTINCT ctx.*, title FROM docs` previously
  deduped by `title` only, silently collapsing rows that differed
  only on a wildcard-expanded field. v1.13.0 deduplicates by the full
  payload when any qualified wildcard is in the SELECT list, matching
  SQL's "DISTINCT considers the whole projected row" semantics.

  *Migration*: queries of the shape
  `SELECT DISTINCT alias.*, col, …` may return more rows than before.
  If the pre-v1.13.0 behavior is required, replace `alias.*` with the
  specific columns that should participate in the dedup key. Pinned
  by
  `collection::search::query::distinct_tests::tests::test_distinct_mixed_with_qualified_wildcard_dedupes_by_full_payload`.

### Changed — API hardening (v1.13.0 pre-release)

Five HIGH findings from a triple Rust-expert review landed as zero-tech-debt
fixes during the develop→main rebase window. Public API only; no runtime
behaviour change.

- **`AnyCollection` variant access redesign.** The previous
  `as_vector_collection_unchecked(self) -> VectorCollection` (plus its
  deprecated alias `into_vector_collection`) is replaced by a full std-style
  matrix: `as_vector / as_vector_mut / into_vector(…) -> Result<…, Self>`
  (plus `as_graph*`, `as_metadata*`, `into_graph`, `into_metadata`). The
  unchecked cross-cast survives only as `unsafe fn into_vector_unchecked`
  so the logical-soundness contract is explicit at every call site. The
  velesdb-mobile and tauri-plugin-velesdb bindings migrated to the safe
  `into_vector()` API; the Python SDK keeps `into_vector_unchecked` under
  a documented `// SAFETY:` block. See
  [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) — F2.2.

- **`CsrCache::get_if_clean` renamed to `clean_snapshot`.** Aligns with
  VelesDB's existing `Snapshot` terminology (`Bm25Snapshot`, `HnswSnapshot`,
  `to_snapshot`, `from_snapshot`). Option semantics unchanged.

- **`WindowFunctionType` marked `#[non_exhaustive]`.** Future window
  functions (`LAG`, `LEAD`, `NTILE`, aggregate windows, …) can now be
  added without a semver break. Downstream crates matching on the enum
  must include a `_ =>` wildcard arm.

- **`ConcurrentEdgeStore::rebuild_snapshot` locking contract documented.**
  The `# Note` docstring now explicitly forbids callers from holding an
  `edge_ids` write lock or any `shards[*]` write lock when invoking this
  method, and cross-references `docs/CONCURRENCY_MODEL.md`.

### Added — GPU acceleration

- **GPU HNSW layer-0 traversal** (`#626`, closes `#502`): SONG paper
  3-stage pipeline on wgpu. New modules:
  - `crates/velesdb-core/src/gpu/gpu_traversal.rs` — pipeline
    orchestration (CSR snapshot cache, generation-based invalidation,
    double-buffered frontier, adaptive 10–20 iterations based on
    `ef_search`).
  - `crates/velesdb-core/src/gpu/gpu_traversal_buffers.rs` — GPU
    buffer management.
  - `crates/velesdb-core/src/gpu/gpu_traversal_pipelines.rs` —
    compute-shader pipeline setup (EXPAND_FRONTIER, TRAVERSAL_*
    distance kernels for Euclidean-squared / Cosine / DotProduct,
    SELECT_TOPK with workgroup-local bitonic sort).
  - `crates/velesdb-core/src/index/hnsw/native/graph/gpu_search.rs`
    — search entry point with correctness-gate guard
    (`should_traverse_gpu`) and CPU fallback.

  All iterations dispatched in a single command buffer (no per-iter
  CPU↔GPU sync), activated behind the existing `--features gpu` flag.
  Gate: `num_vectors > 500_000` AND `num_vectors * dim ≤ u32::MAX`.
  Below either threshold, or on any GPU error, returns `None` so the
  caller falls back to the CPU SIMD path — no behavior change for
  workloads outside the GPU activation range.

### Added — GPU hardening (post-landing follow-ups to `#626`)

The four PRs below were merged the day v1.13.0 was cut to close the
`🚩 ANALYSIS` findings Devin raised during the `#626` review. All are
tracked under `#634` as sub-items PR-A / PR-B / PR-D / PR-F. Net
effect: the GPU feature is reachable from production code paths,
invalidation contracts are enforced statically in debug builds, and
future mutators (e.g. a delete path) cannot accidentally serve
stale caches.

- **Wire `search_auto` into the production pipeline** (`#638`, PR-D).
  In the landed state of `#626`, `NativeHnswInner::search_auto` was
  annotated `#[allow(dead_code)]` with no production caller — the GPU
  path was reachable only from unit tests and benchmarks. Routes the
  three in-process search entry points
  (`HnswIndex::search_hnsw_only`,
  `HnswIndex::search_hnsw_only_filtered`,
  `NativeHnswIndex::search_with_quality`) through `search_auto`, so
  any build with `--features gpu` and an index above 500K vectors
  automatically uses the GPU SONG pipeline. Sub-500K indices, RaBitQ
  backends, and builds without `gpu` continue on the CPU SIMD path
  with zero overhead. 5 new parity / routing tests (GPU ⇔ CPU top-k
  equivalence on small indices).

- **Explicit lock-ordering + CsrCache caller contract** (`#637`, PR-A).
  Adds `LockRank::GpuVectorsSnapshot = 5` to the global lock order in
  `graph/locking.rs` (acquired before `Vectors` = 10) and instruments
  all three acquisition sites (`gpu_search.rs`, `insert.rs`,
  `backend_adapter.rs`) so debug builds catch any future caller that
  inverts the order. Fixes the misleading "CAS on generation" comment
  on `CsrCache::get_or_rebuild` and adds a
  `debug_assert!(holds_lock(Layers))` tripwire encoding the caller
  contract (rebuilders must hold the layers read lock; without it,
  overlapping rebuilders could silently commit stale CSRs). New
  `holds_lock` helper + 3 regression tests for rank monotonicity
  and nested-acquire semantics.

- **Unified version counter for snapshot + CSR cache invalidation**
  (`#640`, PR-B). Replaces the count-keyed snapshot cache with a
  monotonic `gpu_snapshot_version: AtomicU64` that every mutation
  bumps atomically. Consolidates the two scattered invalidation
  blocks in `insert` and `parallel_insert` into a single
  `NativeHnsw::invalidate_gpu_caches` helper (version bump → CSR
  dirty flag → snapshot mutex clear, all in the declared lock order).
  Prevents the delete-then-insert-back-to-same-count bug class that
  would silently serve stale vectors to the GPU. Also folds the
  pre-existing `reorder_for_locality` invalidation gap — reordering
  rewrites vectors and neighbour lists in place but historically
  never invalidated the GPU caches.

- **CSR cache count-check cleanup** (`#641`, PR-F). Removes the
  redundant `existing.num_nodes == count` secondary check in
  `search_gpu`. Every mutation bumps `gpu_snapshot_version` AND calls
  `gpu_csr_cache.invalidate()` through the helper, so `clean_snapshot`
  (renamed from `get_if_clean` in the v1.13.0 API-hardening pass)
  alone is the authoritative validity signal — "cache clean" ⇔
  "snapshot version unchanged" ⇔ "topology unchanged since last
  build". Removes the code-smell that kept pattern-matching against
  the old count-keyed cache bug.

### Added — Pre-seed remediation

- **Phase 4.3 — HNSW sequential loop prefetch** (`#623`, progresses
  `#377`): `search_loop_sequential` now honours `use_prefetch` so
  datasets below the 10K pipeline threshold also benefit from
  intra-gather software prefetch. `NativeHnsw::search_layer` refactored
  via Fowler extract-function to `dispatch_layer_search` for clarity
  and NLOC compliance. Measured gains (i9-14900KF, criterion): 
  `search_layer/768d/ef50` −12.2 %, `ef128` −16.4 %, `ef256` −14.3 %;
  `search_layer/128d/ef50` −21.7 %. Prefetch is a CPU hint only — recall
  unchanged by construction (22/22 recall tests pass).

- **Phase 4.2 — Sparse search 16× speedup** (`#621`, closes `#378`):
  k-way merge in `get_all_postings` + `get_merged_postings_for_compaction`
  eliminates O(N log N) sort, and corpus-size-aware routing adds a
  `linear_scan_dense` fast path for corpora ≤ 100K (accumulator stays
  L2-resident). `sparse_search(top-10, 10K docs, SPLADE)` drops from
  ≈956 µs to ≈57.6 µs; top-100 drops 927 µs → 75.1 µs. Block-Max WAND
  was implemented and passed parity (10/10 vs brute-force) but regressed
  +65 % on this workload; kept in git history for reference but routed
  out — a lesson on "profile before implementing a complex structure".

- **Phase 4.1 — BM25 persistence cold-start** (`#619`, `#620` docs,
  closes `#389`): BM25 index now persists via snapshot + WAL with a
  generation counter committing `meta` last as the authoritative point.
  Cold-start dropped from O(N) rebuild (re-tokenize every document) to
  O(1) snapshot load. `KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md` entry for BM25 cold-start
  removed by `#620`.

- **Phase 3 refactor wave — duplication cleanup**:
  - `#614` (closes `#450`): WAL/crud dedup — extract histogram + sparse
    WAL helpers. `Collection::upsert` CC 9→8. jscpd 84→82 clones on
    `collection/`.
  - `#615` (closes `#448`): HNSW distance/batch/persistence/search
    dedup. jscpd `hnsw/` 19→9 clones (−53 %). `#[inline]` restored on
    helpers extracted from hot paths (lesson from Devin on PR #615).
  - `#616` (closes `#452`): vector search dispatch dedup — extract
    finalize + validate helpers. jscpd `search/vector.rs` 14.31 %→2.47 %.
  - `#618` (closes `#617`): HNSW `save_sidecars` atomicity fix via
    generation counter; corruption fail-fast instead of silent reset.

- **Phase 2B — CBO ORDER BY similarity routing** (`#613`, scope-reduced
  `#467`): the cost-based optimiser now routes `ORDER BY similarity()`
  queries through the native HNSW path when applicable.

- **Phase 2A — EXPLAIN follow-ups** (`#612`, closes `#607` `#608`
  `#609`): minor EXPLAIN readability and plan-cost consistency fixes.

- **Phase 1 — SIFT1M pin + tunable fallback** (`#611`): JSON fingerprint
  pinning for the SIFT1M fvecs/ivecs payload, filter-strategy fallback
  threshold runtime-tunable via a dedicated knob.

### Added — Benchmarks

- **Standardized SIFT1M ANN benchmark** (1M × 128D vectors, L2 metric) —
  closes the pre-seed benchmark credibility gap by replacing the
  synthetic-only recall reporting with a measurement against the
  de-facto-standard INRIA TEXMEX dataset used throughout the ANN
  literature (Faiss, HNSWlib, ScaNN, DiskANN, Qdrant, Weaviate, Milvus).
  New files:
  - `crates/velesdb-core/benches/datasets/sift1m.rs` — fvecs/ivecs
    loader with `VELESDB_SIFT1M_DIR` env override for offline /
    pre-populated data, streaming SHA-256 fingerprint hook, and
    INRIA mirror download fallback for first-run machines.
  - `crates/velesdb-core/benches/sift1m_recall.rs` — Criterion
    benchmark sweeping `ef_search` ∈ {64, 128, 256, 512} with
    p50 latency (Criterion) + Recall@10 on the full 10,000-query
    set (printed as grep-friendly `RECALL_REPORT` lines).
  - `docs/BENCHMARKS.md § 11` — dataset provenance, methodology,
    how to run, how to interpret, known limitations.
  - `docs/reference/promise-contract.json` — new claim
    `benchmarks_sift1m_recall_at_10`.

  Gated behind `--features bench-sift1m` so CI does not trigger the
  ≈168 MB download. Dev-deps (`flate2`, `tar`, `ureq`, `sha2`) are
  optional production deps activated only by the feature — default,
  WASM, and production builds never pull them in. SHA-256 fingerprints
  are placeholders until the first manually-verified run; loader
  prints observed hashes so they can be pinned rather than fabricated.

### Added — Sprint 2 Wave 4 (TypeScript SDK)

- **12 missing REST endpoint wrappers surfaced on the TS SDK**
  (`sdks/typescript/src/backends/missing-endpoints.ts` + plumbing
  in `rest.ts`, `wasm.ts`, `client.ts`, `types.ts`, Commit 8) —
  closes the `S2-NEW-10` audit finding. The pre-v1.13 SDK
  covered only the core CRUD + search paths; 12 server endpoints
  were un-reachable from TS callers without resorting to
  hand-written `fetch`. Every wrapper is now exposed on
  `VelesDB` and fully typed.

  New methods on `VelesDB`:
  ```typescript
  // Admin
  await db.rebuildIndex('docs');                                // POST /collections/{name}/index/rebuild
  const caps = await db.getGuardrails();                        // GET  /guardrails
  await db.updateGuardrails({ maxDepth: 15, rateLimitQps: 200 }); // PUT  /guardrails

  // Query
  await db.aggregate('SELECT category, COUNT(*) FROM docs GROUP BY category'); // POST /aggregate
  await db.matchQuery('kg', 'MATCH (a:Person)-[:KNOWS]->(b) RETURN b');        // POST /collections/{name}/match

  // Graph
  await db.removeEdge('kg', 42);                                // DELETE /collections/{name}/graph/edges/{id}
  const n = await db.getEdgeCount('kg');                        // GET    /collections/{name}/graph/edges/count
  const nodes = await db.listNodes('kg');                       // GET    /collections/{name}/graph/nodes
  const edges = await db.getNodeEdges('kg', 10, { direction: 'in', label: 'KNOWS' });
  const payload = await db.getNodePayload('kg', 10);            // GET    /collections/{name}/graph/nodes/{id}/payload
  await db.upsertNodePayload('kg', 10, { name: 'Alice' });      // PUT    /collections/{name}/graph/nodes/{id}/payload
  const res = await db.graphSearch('kg', { vector: [...], k: 5 }); // POST  /collections/{name}/graph/search
  ```

  All 12 wrappers honour the `snake_case ↔ camelCase` convention
  used across the existing SDK (request bodies converted
  camel→snake, responses converted snake→camel). `removeEdge`
  follows the same "map-to-null" convention as `getCollection`:
  if the server answers `VELES-020` (edge not found) the helper
  returns `false` instead of throwing, so callers can use the
  boolean return value.

  **Scope limitation (explicit, not a saupoudrage)**: the 13th
  endpoint listed in the audit — `GET /collections/{name}/graph/
  traverse/stream` — is a Server-Sent Events endpoint, not a
  plain JSON response. Wiring it to the TS SDK requires a
  streaming-fetch abstraction that does not exist today in the
  SDK codebase; adding a blocking "collect everything then
  return" wrapper would defeat the whole point of the streaming
  design. Deferred to a dedicated Sprint 3+ "streaming API"
  commit that introduces the abstraction properly.

  **WASM backend**: every new method on `IVelesDBBackend` is
  implemented on `WasmBackend` too, throwing `wasmNotSupported`
  for each — the features require persistent server-side
  infrastructure (guard rails, graph, rebuild). The WASM
  `CapabilityMap` already reports these as `false`.

  New exports from `@wiscale/velesdb-sdk`:
  - `RebuildIndexResponse`, `GuardRailsUpdateRequest`,
    `GuardRailsConfigResponse`, `ListNodesResponse`,
    `GetNodeEdgesOptions`, `NodePayloadResponse`,
    `GraphSearchRequest`, `GraphSearchResponse`,
    `GraphSearchResultItem`, `MatchQueryOptions`,
    `AggregateQueryOptions`

- **`db.capabilities()` API — static feature map per backend**
  (`sdks/typescript/src/capabilities.ts` + client + both backends,
  Commit 7) — closes the `#24 F-BACK-002` audit finding. Callers
  can now inspect the active backend's feature set at
  construction time and gracefully degrade their workflow instead
  of catching a runtime `NOT_SUPPORTED` error after the fact.

  ```typescript
  import { VelesDB, type CapabilityMap } from '@wiscale/velesdb-sdk';

  const db = new VelesDB({ backend: 'wasm' });
  await db.init();

  const caps: Readonly<CapabilityMap> = db.capabilities();
  if (caps.graphTraversal) {
    await db.traverseGraph('kg', { source: 1, direction: 'out' });
  } else {
    // WASM backend does not ship graph traversal — fall back to
    // REST or a pure in-memory traversal
  }
  ```

  The map is **frozen at backend construction** and does NOT
  round-trip to a live server. It reflects the features the SDK
  version actually wraps for the selected backend — callers who
  want live server feature flags should still catch `VelesError`
  at the call site.

  `CapabilityMap` has 13 boolean fields covering every major SDK
  surface: `vectorSearch`, `textSearch`, `hybridSearch`,
  `multiQuerySearch`, `sparseSearch`, `scroll`, `graphTraversal`,
  `secondaryIndexes`, `agentMemory`, `streamInsert`, `pqTraining`,
  `velesqlQuery`, `collectionIntrospection`. REST advertises all
  13 as `true`; WASM advertises the 5 search-and-query paths as
  `true` and the 8 persistent/graph/streaming paths as `false`
  (matching the `wasmNotSupported()` stubs).

  New exports from `@wiscale/velesdb-sdk`:
  - `CapabilityMap` (interface)
  - `REST_CAPABILITIES`, `WASM_CAPABILITIES` (frozen singletons)

- **WASM backend index-management stubs now throw explicitly**
  (`sdks/typescript/src/backends/wasm-stubs.ts`, Commit 6) — closes
  the `#23 F-BACK-001` audit finding where `wasmListIndexes`,
  `wasmHasIndex`, and `wasmDropIndex` silently returned `[]` and
  `false` respectively. Those empty results made callers believe
  "this collection has no indexes / the drop succeeded" when in
  reality the WASM backend does not support index management at
  all. The stubs now throw a `VelesDBError` with code
  `'NOT_SUPPORTED'` via the shared `wasmNotSupported()` helper,
  making the capability boundary visible upfront.

  ```typescript
  const db = new VelesDB({ backend: 'wasm' });
  await db.init();

  // Pre-v1.13: silently returned [] — caller never knew the op
  //            was unsupported and wrote code around an empty list.
  // v1.13:     throws VelesDBError('... not supported in WASM
  //            backend. Use REST backend.')
  try {
    const indexes = await db.listIndexes('docs');
  } catch (e) {
    if (e instanceof VelesDBError && e.code === 'NOT_SUPPORTED') {
      // fall back to REST backend or a pure in-memory index
    }
  }
  ```

  `wasmCreateIndex` is also aligned onto the shared
  `wasmNotSupported()` helper (it previously threw a bespoke
  `Error`) so all four index-management stubs emit identical error
  shapes.

- **`SearchOptions.quality` forwarded to REST as `mode`**
  (`sdks/typescript/src/search-quality.ts` +
  `backends/search-backend.ts`, Commit 5) — the `quality` field that
  has lived on `SearchOptions` since v1.4 is now actually delivered
  to the server on the three search endpoints that support it
  natively: `search`, `searchIds`, `searchBatch`. Closes the
  `#22 F-API-001` audit finding.

  ```typescript
  // Named presets
  await db.search('docs', query, { k: 10, quality: 'fast' });
  await db.search('docs', query, { k: 10, quality: 'accurate' });
  await db.search('docs', query, { k: 10, quality: 'autotune' });

  // Template-literal presets (parsed server-side by
  // velesdb_core::api_types::mode_to_search_quality)
  await db.search('docs', query, { k: 10, quality: 'custom:256' });
  await db.search('docs', query, { k: 10, quality: 'adaptive:64:512' });

  // Per-sub-request on batch
  await db.searchBatch('docs', [
    { vector: v1, k: 10, quality: 'fast' },
    { vector: v2, k: 10, quality: 'accurate' },
  ]);
  ```

  The new `searchQualityToMode(quality)` helper exported from
  `@wiscale/velesdb-sdk` is a pure string pass-through: it returns
  `{ mode: quality }` when a value is supplied and `{}` when
  undefined, so spreading its result into a request body is safe and
  keys are omitted cleanly when the caller doesn't override the
  default.

  **Scope limitation (explicit, not a saupoudrage)**: `textSearch`,
  `hybridSearch`, and `multiQuerySearch` do NOT accept `quality`.
  Their core entry points (`VectorCollection::text_search`,
  `::hybrid_search`, `::multi_query_search`) do not currently take
  an `ef_search` or `SearchQuality` parameter — adding the option
  to the SDK would create a silently-ignored field. Supporting
  quality on those paths requires extending the core first and is
  tracked as a follow-up (candidate for Sprint 3+).

- **`hnsw_alpha` and `hnsw_max_elements` exposed on `POST /collections`**
  (`velesdb-server::CreateCollectionRequest` + `velesdb-server::handlers::collections::build_hnsw_params_override`
  + `sdks/typescript/src/backends/crud-backend.ts`, Commit 4) —
  closes the `#21 PROP-HNSW-ALPHA` audit finding where the TS SDK's
  `HnswParams` interface advertised `alpha` and `maxElements` but the
  REST layer silently dropped them.

  Both fields existed in the core `HnswParams` struct (used by the
  Python SDK via v1.13 `HnswOptions`) but the REST handler's
  `create_vector_collection_with_hnsw` path only carried `hnsw_m`
  and `hnsw_ef_construction`. The handler now routes through
  `Database::create_vector_collection_with_params` (the same entry
  point Python uses) whenever any HNSW tuning field is supplied,
  building a full `HnswParams` from `HnswParams::auto(dimension)`
  and overriding just the fields the caller provided.

  ```typescript
  import { VelesDB } from '@wiscale/velesdb-sdk';
  const db = new VelesDB({ backend: 'rest', url: 'http://localhost:8080' });
  await db.init();

  await db.createCollection('rag', {
    dimension: 1536,
    metric: 'cosine',
    storageMode: 'full',
    hnsw: {
      m: 48,
      efConstruction: 600,
      alpha: 1.5,            // NEW — VAMANA diversification
      maxElements: 1_000_000 // NEW — pre-size for bulk import
    },
  });
  ```

  Any combination of the four HNSW fields is valid: supplying only
  `alpha` works, supplying only `maxElements` works, and the
  unspecified fields inherit the dimension-aware engine defaults.
  `GET /collections/{name}/config` echoes the full `hnsw_params`
  block so callers can verify the persisted values.

  **Backward compatible**: the two new fields are optional on the
  wire (`#[serde(default)]`). Pre-v1.13 clients that send only
  `hnsw_m` / `hnsw_ef_construction` continue to work unchanged, and
  the legacy `Database::create_vector_collection_with_hnsw` helper
  remains in the core API for other callers (Python, CLI, WASM).

- **Advanced `CollectionConfig` fields wired through to REST**
  (`sdks/typescript/src/types.ts` + `backends/crud-backend.ts` +
  `backends/admin-backend.ts`, Commit 3) — the TS SDK now exposes
  every advanced create-time option accepted by
  `velesdb_core::api_types::CreateCollectionRequest` and every
  advanced field returned by `CollectionConfigResponse`. Closes the
  `#18 PROP-CONFIG-ADVANCED` audit finding.

  New create-time fields on `CollectionConfig`:

  ```typescript
  import { VelesDB, type CollectionConfig } from '@wiscale/velesdb-sdk';

  const config: CollectionConfig = {
    dimension: 1536,
    metric: 'cosine',
    storageMode: 'pq',
    hnsw: { m: 48, efConstruction: 600 },
    // — NEW advanced options (all optional, default to engine behaviour) —
    pqRescoreOversampling: 8,                        // PQ/SQ8 candidate rescoring factor
    deferredIndexing: {                              // US-366 in-memory buffer
      enabled: true,
      mergeThreshold: 5000,
      maxBufferAgeMs: 30_000,
    },
    asyncIndexBuilder: {                             // Issue #488 parallel bulk build
      mergeThreshold: 50_000,
      segmentCount: 8,
    },
  };
  await db.createCollection('rag', config);
  ```

  The three new sub-interfaces (`DeferredIndexerOptions`,
  `AsyncIndexBuilderOptions`) are TS-ergonomic camelCase mirrors of
  the Rust `DeferredIndexerConfig` / `AsyncIndexBuilderConfig`
  structs. The crud-backend converts them to the snake_case wire
  format (`merge_threshold`, `max_buffer_age_ms`, `segment_count`)
  before forwarding, and omits any field the caller did not supply
  so the server falls back to its defaults.

  New read-time fields on `CollectionConfigResponse`:
  `schemaVersion`, `pqRescoreOversampling`, `hnswParams`,
  `deferredIndexing`, `asyncIndexBuilder`. Consumers can now inspect
  the on-disk schema version and the effective advanced configuration
  of an existing collection via `db.getCollectionConfig()`.

  **Backward compatible**: every new field is optional. Callers that
  don't pass them see zero behavioural change — the REST body omits
  the keys and the server applies defaults. Existing code compiles
  and runs unchanged.

- **Typed error hierarchy with verbatim `VELES-XXX` codes**
  (`sdks/typescript/src/errors.ts`, Commit 2) — 36 typed error classes,
  one per `velesdb_core::Error` variant, all extending a new `VelesError`
  base class which itself extends `VelesDBError` for backward compat.
  Closes the `#20 PROP-ERR-TSSDK` audit finding.

  ```typescript
  import {
    CollectionNotFoundError,
    DimensionMismatchError,
    GuardRailError,
    VelesError,
  } from '@wiscale/velesdb-sdk';

  try {
    await db.search('docs', queryVector, { k: 10 });
  } catch (e) {
    if (e instanceof CollectionNotFoundError) {
      // VELES-002 — e.code is preserved verbatim
      console.log('code:', e.code); // "VELES-002"
    } else if (e instanceof DimensionMismatchError) {
      // VELES-004
    } else if (e instanceof GuardRailError) {
      // VELES-027 — rate limit, timeout, cardinality, etc.
    } else if (e instanceof VelesError) {
      // Any other VELES-XXX, forward-compat with newer core versions
    } else {
      throw e;
    }
  }
  ```

  The SDK no longer fabricates fake codes like `'NOT_FOUND'` when
  dispatching server responses. The transport layer (`shared.ts::throwOnError`)
  now routes via `parseVelesError(code, message)`, which instantiates
  the matching typed class from the server's exact `VELES-XXX` code.

  **Backward compatibility**: the four legacy client-side error classes
  (`ConnectionError`, `ValidationError`, `NotFoundError`, `BackpressureError`)
  are unchanged — they cover connection/validation/WASM-lookup scenarios
  that never carry a `VELES-XXX` code. Existing `catch (e instanceof
  VelesDBError)` handlers continue to catch everything they did before.

  New exports from `@wiscale/velesdb-sdk`:
  - `VelesError` (base class for server errors)
  - 36 typed sub-classes (`CollectionNotFoundError`, `DimensionMismatchError`,
    `StorageError`, `QueryError`, `GuardRailError`, ...)
  - `parseVelesError(code, message)` — runtime discriminator factory
  - `VELES_ERROR_CODES` — ordered const array of all 36 codes
  - `VelesErrorCode` — union type of every known code

- **Typed `Filter` DSL** (`sdks/typescript/src/filter.ts`, Commit 1) —
  discriminated union mirror of `velesdb_core::filter::Condition`
  (20 operators) with a fluent builder `f.*` for ergonomic filter
  construction. Closes the `#19 PROP-FILTER-UNTYPED` audit finding.

  ```typescript
  import { f, VelesDB } from '@wiscale/velesdb-sdk';

  const db = new VelesDB({ backend: 'rest', url: 'http://localhost:8080' });
  await db.init();

  // Typed builder (recommended — compile-time checked)
  const filter = f.and([
    f.eq('category', 'tech'),
    f.gte('price', 100),
    f.or([f.ilike('title', '%rust%'), f.ilike('title', '%go%')]),
    f.not(f.isNull('author')),
  ]);

  const results = await db.search('docs', queryVector, { k: 10, filter });
  ```

  The 20 operators mirror the Rust enum exactly and serialize to the
  same wire format (`{type, field, value}` with `rename_all = "snake_case"`):
  `eq`, `neq`, `gt`, `gte`, `lt`, `lte`, `in`, `contains`, `is_null`,
  `is_not_null`, `and`, `or`, `not`, `like`, `ilike`, `array_contains`,
  `array_contains_any`, `array_contains_all`, `geo_distance`, `geo_bbox`.

  **Backward compatible**: pre-v1.13 code passing
  `filter: Record<string, unknown>` continues to work unchanged. The
  new `FilterInput = Filter | Record<string, unknown>` type is
  accepted by every `filter?` parameter across `SearchOptions`,
  `MultiQuerySearchOptions`, `ScrollRequest`, `searchBatch`,
  `textSearch`, `hybridSearch`, and all WASM/REST backend variants.

  New exports from `@wiscale/velesdb-sdk`:
  - `Filter`, `Condition`, `CompareOp`, `FilterInput`, `JsonValue` (types)
  - `f` (fluent builder), `isTypedFilter`, `normalizeFilter` (runtime helpers)

### Breaking Changes
- **`Collection` removed from public API** — `Collection` is now `pub(crate)` only. External code
  must use `VectorCollection`, `GraphCollection`, `MetadataCollection`, or `AnyCollection`.
- **`Database::get_collection()` removed** — Use `get_vector_collection()`, `get_graph_collection()`,
  `get_metadata_collection()`, or `get_any_collection()` instead.

#### Sprint 2 Wave 3 B2 — Python typed-options surface (Commits 10-12)

- **`Database.create_collection` flat HNSW kwargs removed** — the legacy
  `m=`, `ef_construction=`, and `expected_vectors=` kwargs are replaced
  by a single typed `hnsw=HnswOptions(...)` parameter. A new
  `auto_reindex=AutoReindexOptions(...)` parameter attaches a runtime-only
  `AutoReindexManager` to the freshly-created collection.

  ```python
  # v1.12 — DEPRECATED
  db.create_collection("docs", dimension=768, m=48, ef_construction=600)
  db.create_collection("big", dimension=128, expected_vectors=1_000_000)

  # v1.13 — current
  from velesdb import HnswOptions, AutoReindexOptions
  db.create_collection(
      "docs", dimension=768, hnsw=HnswOptions(m=48, ef_construction=600),
  )
  db.create_collection(
      "big", dimension=128, hnsw=HnswOptions.for_dataset_size(128, 1_000_000),
  )
  db.create_collection(
      "agents", dimension=384,
      auto_reindex=AutoReindexOptions(min_size_for_reindex=5_000),
  )
  ```

- **`Database(path)` accepts an optional `config=VelesConfigOptions(...)`**
  kwarg for database-level configuration (currently surfaces
  `LimitsOptions` for tenant-wide guard-rails; other sub-sections stay
  at engine defaults):

  ```python
  from velesdb import Database, LimitsOptions, VelesConfigOptions
  db = Database(
      "./tenant1",
      config=VelesConfigOptions(limits=LimitsOptions(max_collections=50)),
  )
  ```

- **`WalBatchOptions` is NOT exposed in Python** — concurrent multi-writer
  WAL is a velesdb-premium Enterprise feature. See
  `docs/guides/WRITE_CONCURRENCY.md` for the positioning and
  `docs/CORE_WIRING_DEBT.md` for the technical rationale.

- **`HnswOptions` presets** (Commit 11) — five classmethods for common
  tuning profiles, each a 1:1 wrapper around the matching
  `HnswParams` core factory:
  - `HnswOptions.fast()` — M=16, ef_construction=150
  - `HnswOptions.turbo()` — M=12, ef_construction=100 (~85% recall)
  - `HnswOptions.balanced(dimension)` — engine default for the dim
  - `HnswOptions.high_recall(dimension)` — balanced + 8 M, +200 ef
  - `HnswOptions.max_recall(dimension)` — tightest recall preset

- **`PyGraphCollection.store_node_payload` renamed to `upsert_node_payload`**
  (Commit 12) — aligns the Python surface with the core API and the
  rest of the `upsert*` naming convention:

  ```python
  # v1.12 — DEPRECATED
  graph.store_node_payload(node_id, {"name": "Alice"})

  # v1.13 — current
  graph.upsert_node_payload(node_id, {"name": "Alice"})
  ```

- **`ParsedStatement.table_name` removed** (Commit 12) — use the
  canonical `collection_name` getter instead (which has been the
  preferred name since v1.8):

  ```python
  # v1.12 — DEPRECATED
  parsed = VelesQL.parse("SELECT * FROM docs")
  print(parsed.table_name)   # "docs"

  # v1.13 — current
  print(parsed.collection_name)  # "docs"
  ```

### Added — Sprint 2 Wave 3 B2

- **`Database::open_with_config(path, VelesConfig)`** (Commit 6) — new
  core constructor that threads a `VelesConfig` through
  `Database::open_impl`. Backed by a new `Database::config()` /
  `Database::config_arc()` accessor surface for read-only inspection.
- **`LimitsConfig::max_collections` + `max_dimensions` enforcement**
  (Commit 7) — both limits are now enforced at collection creation.
  `max_collections` counts across every typed registry (vector +
  graph + metadata). `max_dimensions` gates both vector and
  graph-with-embedding paths. Rejections produce `Error::GuardRail`
  with a `current / cap` ratio string.
- **`Database::create_vector_collection_with_params`** (Commit 5) —
  full-config constructor accepting `(name, dimension, metric,
  storage_mode, hnsw_params, pq_rescore_oversampling)`. The
  `storage_mode` argument wins over any `hnsw_params.storage_mode`
  field, preserving explicit override semantics. Used internally by
  the Python `Database.create_collection(..., hnsw=HnswOptions(...))`
  path.
- **`VectorCollection::attach_auto_reindex` / `detach_auto_reindex` /
  `auto_reindex_manager` / `check_auto_reindex_divergence`** (Commit 9)
  — runtime-only attachment of an `AutoReindexManager` to a
  collection. No persistence: callers must re-attach after every
  `Database::open`. The bulk upsert hot path consults the attached
  manager and emits a `tracing::info!` event on divergence.
  Automatic reindex reconstruction is out of scope — it is left to
  the caller or an event-driven background task.

### Added — Documentation (Commit 8 W3-honest + Commit 13)

- **`docs/CORE_WIRING_DEBT.md`** — internal engineering debt catalogue
  listing every `*Config` struct that is parsed but not fully wired
  to the runtime, with explicit outcome per entry (wired in
  Community, transferred to velesdb-premium, or scheduled removal).
- **`docs/guides/WRITE_CONCURRENCY.md`** — customer-facing guide
  explaining the single-writer-per-collection model, the three
  Community best-practices (batching, sharding, async ingestion),
  the anti-pattern to avoid, the Enterprise tier positioning, and
  an FAQ.
- **Cross-references added** in `docs/CONCURRENCY_MODEL.md` and
  `docs/guides/CONCURRENCY_LOCKING.md` pointing at the new
  `WRITE_CONCURRENCY.md` guide.
- **`docs/README.md`** — new "Write Concurrency" entry in the User
  Guides table.

### Changed — Python error handling (Commits 1-4)

- **Typed VelesDB exception hierarchy** — 36 `Error::VELES-XXX` core
  variants are now mapped to Python exception subclasses via a
  centralized `core_err()` helper. Three new exception types:
  `CollectionExistsError`, `EdgeExistsError`, `DatabaseLockedError`,
  all inheriting from `VelesDBError`. Every mutation path routes
  through `core_err` instead of stringly-typed `PyRuntimeError`.
- **GIL release on every `Database` mutation** — `Database.__new__`,
  `create_collection`, `delete_collection`, `create_metadata_collection`,
  `create_graph_collection`, `analyze_collection`, `get_collection_stats`,
  `execute_query`, and `ScrollIterator.__next__` now release the GIL
  via `py.allow_threads` around the core call. Unlocks parallel
  Python worker throughput on multi-core machines.

### Added
- **Cost model calibration from histograms (Issue #467)** —
  `OperationCostFactors` are now calibrated dynamically during `analyze()` from
  collection statistics and equi-depth histograms, replacing the former hard-coded
  constants (`FILTER_SCAN_IO_WEIGHT=0.2`, `FILTER_SCAN_CPU_WEIGHT=0.8`,
  `HNSW_IO_WEIGHT=0.5`, `HNSW_CPU_WEIGHT=1.0`). New public types/fields:
  `CostFactorBounds` (safety bounds), `OperationCostFactors::hdd_optimized()`,
  `OperationCostFactors::clamped()`, `OperationCostFactors::is_default()`,
  `CollectionStats::calibrated_cost_factors`. CBO behavior change:
  `QueryPlanner::choose_strategy_with_cbo()` now derives I/O/CPU weights from
  calibrated factors instead of duplicating `0.2`/`0.8` literals. `ExplainOutput`
  gains `cost_factors` and `calibration_source` fields for observability.
  Backward compatible: default factors produce identical costs to the old
  constants; older `collection.stats.json` files without `calibrated_cost_factors`
  deserialize to `None` via `#[serde(default)]`.
- **Histogram-based selectivity estimation — CBO foundation (Issue #468)** —
  Equi-depth histograms built during `ANALYZE` on Int, Float, and String columns
  (10K-row sample, 64 buckets default). `CostEstimator` now dispatches on all 6
  `CompareOp` variants (Eq/NotEq/Lt/Lte/Gt/Gte) with O(log B) binary search on
  bucket boundaries. Histogram-aware selectivity for `IN`, `BETWEEN`, and prefix
  `LIKE` predicates. Explicit heuristic constants for `Match` (0.1),
  `ContainsText` (0.05), `Contains` (0.1), `GeoDistance` (0.1), `GeoBbox` (0.2)
  — eliminates the `_ => 0.5` catch-all. Incremental bucket maintenance on
  upsert/delete with 20% staleness threshold. `FilterPlan` gains
  `estimated_rows` and `estimation_method` fields. Histograms persist in
  `collection.stats.json` with `#[serde(default)]` backward compatibility.
  4 BDD integration tests + 30 unit tests + 6 persistence tests.
- **Python DataFrame integration + Scroll cursor + Polars support (Issue #429)** —
  New `Collection.scroll()` generator for server-side cursor-based iteration over
  collection points (yields batches of `list[dict]` or DataFrames). New
  `Collection.to_dataframe()`, `Collection.query_to_dataframe()`, and
  `Collection.upsert_from_dataframe()` convenience methods for Pandas/Polars
  DataFrame conversion. Pandas and Polars are optional dependencies
  (`pip install velesdb[pandas]`, `pip install velesdb[polars]`). All DataFrame
  imports are deferred — zero overhead when not used. Rust-native `scroll_batch`
  on `Collection` core with ascending-ID cursor, optional payload filtering,
  and O(log n + batch_size) per batch. Type stubs updated for all new methods.
- **Strict text filter `CONTAINS_TEXT` operator (Issue #446)** — New VelesQL operator
  `column CONTAINS_TEXT 'keyword'` performs case-sensitive substring matching as a strict
  metadata filter. Unlike `MATCH` (RRF boost), `CONTAINS_TEXT` guarantees every returned
  result contains the specified substring. Maps to existing `filter::Condition::Contains`
  at runtime — no new filter evaluation logic. Five touch points: grammar rule, AST variant
  (`ContainsTextCondition`), parser function, filter conversion, and EXPLAIN formatting
  (`column CONTAINS_TEXT ?`). Supports hybrid search (`vector NEAR $v AND content CONTAINS_TEXT 'keyword'`),
  standalone metadata filtering, and combination with `MATCH` for boost + strict filter.
  Case-insensitive keyword parsing. 10 BDD integration tests.
- **EXPLAIN ANALYZE: ActualStats population during query execution (Issue #466)** —
  New `explain_analyze_query()` method on `Database` that executes a query with lightweight
  instrumentation and returns both the estimated plan and actual execution statistics
  (`actual_rows`, `actual_time_ms`, `loops`, `nodes_visited`, `edges_traversed`).
  Per-node statistics (`NodeStats`) provide time and row counts for each plan node.
  CLI `.explain-analyze` command displays plan + actual stats side-by-side with `⚠` divergence
  warnings. HTTP `/query/explain` endpoint supports `"analyze": true` for JSON stats.
  Python bindings expose `explain_analyze()` on `Collection` and `GraphCollection`.
  `ExplainOutput` and `ActualStats` structs activated (removed `#[allow(dead_code)]`).
  Zero overhead on non-ANALYZE queries. Foundational for CBO feedback loop (#467–#469).
- **Secondary index bitmap for IN/NOT IN filters (Issue #512)** — `bitmap_from_condition` now
  handles `Condition::In` and `Condition::Not { In }` via secondary index B-tree lookups.
  Builds a `RoaringBitmap` by unioning per-value lookups (O(N × log K)), restricting HNSW
  traversal to matching points only. NOT IN uses universe bitmap subtraction. New
  `ColumnStore::filter_in_string_bitmap` and `filter_in_int_bitmap` for JOIN-side IN filtering.
  EXPLAIN plan now indicates bitmap pre-filter for IN on indexed fields. BDD + unit tests,
  zero regression on existing queries.
- **Cross-collection JOIN optimization (Issue #513)** — Filter pushdown and lookup join for
  `execute_single_select`. WHERE conditions referencing the joined table (e.g.,
  `inventory.price > 100`) are automatically pushed down before ColumnStore construction.
  When the JOIN key is the primary key (`id`) and no pushdown filters apply, direct
  `collection.get()` lookups replace full-scan ColumnStore builds. Reuses existing
  `analyze_for_pushdown`, `Filter::matches`, and `build_join_column_store` infrastructure.
  11 new BDD tests, zero regression on existing 8 cross-collection tests.
- **EXPLAIN now surfaces WITH/LET/FUSION** — `ef_search` is read from `WITH clause` instead of
  hardcoded to 100; `WITH options`, `LET bindings`, and `FUSION` details (strategy, k, weights)
  are now displayed in the EXPLAIN output tree. Closes #471.
- **Python typed exception hierarchy** — `VelesDBError`, `DimensionMismatchError`, and
  `CollectionNotFoundError` are now catchable as typed Python exceptions. Bulk upsert errors
  include the point index (e.g., `"Point at index 4237 missing 'id' field"`). Closes #427.
- **Python performance guide** — `docs/guides/PYTHON_PERFORMANCE.md` documents numpy fast-paths,
  `upsert_bulk_numpy()`, `batch_search()`, and threading patterns. Closes #409.
- **Array Column Type with CONTAINS filter (Issue #510)** — `ColumnType::Array(Box<ColumnType>)`
  for multi-value fields (tags, categories, amenities). Three VelesQL operators:
  `CONTAINS value`, `CONTAINS ANY (v1, v2)`, `CONTAINS ALL (v1, v2)`. Bitmap-native filters
  (`filter_contains_bitmap`, `filter_contains_any_bitmap`, `filter_contains_all_bitmap`).
  SmallVec<8> storage for zero heap allocation on small arrays. 30 BDD + 22 unit tests.
- **GeoPoint Column Type with GEO_DISTANCE and GEO_BBOX filters (Issue #514)** —
  `ColumnType::GeoPoint` storing `(lat, lng)` coordinate pairs. Haversine-based
  `GEO_DISTANCE(column, lat, lng) <op> meters` for proximity queries and
  `GEO_BBOX(column, lat_min, lng_min, lat_max, lng_max)` for bounding-box containment.
  Bitmap-native filter variants. Coordinate validation at insertion time.
  Full VelesQL grammar, parser, AST, filter conversion, and payload matching integration.
  12 BDD + 22 unit tests.
- **Parent-document retrieval GROUP BY MAX_SIM (Issue #511)** — Vector-search-aware GROUP BY
  for chunked document collections. Groups search results by a parent field with score
  aggregation: `MAX(score)` (ColBERT-style MaxSim), `AVG(score)` (mean similarity), and
  `FIRST(column)` (excerpt from highest-scoring chunk). Single-pass O(N) FxHashMap grouping
  with ≤20% latency overhead. 11 BDD + 8 unit tests.
- **`AnyCollection` enum** — Type-erased collection handle for callers that don't know the
  collection type at compile time. Zero-cost dispatch via enum match (no vtable, no heap).
  Methods: `config()`, `flush()`, `point_count()`, `is_empty()`, `name()`, `execute_query_str()`,
  `execute_aggregate()`, `diagnostics()`, `into_vector_collection()`.
- **`AnyCollection::into_vector_collection()`** — Converts any collection variant to
  `VectorCollection` for SDK bindings that expose a single Collection type.
- **`Database::get_any_collection()`** — Returns `Option<AnyCollection>` by checking
  vector → graph → metadata registries in order.
- **BDD tests** — 14 new BDD tests for `AnyCollection` dispatch, persistence round-trip,
  typed registry integrity, and edge cases.

### Added (migrate)
- **Graph migration stats surfaced** — `MigrationStats` now includes `edges_created`,
  `edges_failed`, and `relations_processed` from the graph migration phase. The wizard
  success output displays these fields when a graph phase ran.
- **`GraphMigrationPhase::close()`** — explicit connector close method; called after
  `run()` in the pipeline for proper resource cleanup.
- **Empty-batch guard in graph extraction loop** — prevents infinite loop when a
  cursor-based connector returns `has_more=true` with an empty batch.
- **Milvus `usize::try_from()` cast** — consistent with ChromaDB, replaces `as usize`
  truncating cast with an explicit `try_from().unwrap_or(usize::MAX)`.

### Fixed
- **LET bindings in SELECT projection (Issue #473)** — LET binding values now injected into
  result payloads during post-processing. LET bindings take precedence over payload fields
  with the same name.
- **Python SDK compilation errors** — Fixed `hybrid_search_with_filter` extra argument,
  `dispatch_search` method names (`sparse_search`, `hybrid_sparse_search`).
- **Python `get_collection()` returns None for graph/metadata** — Now uses `get_any_collection`
  to find collections regardless of type.
- **Python `create_metadata_collection()` disconnected instance** — Now returns the registered
  instance via `get_any_collection` instead of creating a disconnected `VectorCollection::open`.
- **Tauri `require_collection` vector-only** — Now uses `get_any_collection` so graph and
  metadata collections are accessible through Tauri commands.
- **Mobile SDK disconnected instance** — `get_collection` now uses `get_any_collection`
  instead of falling back to `VectorCollection::open`.

### Migration Guide
1. **`velesdb_core::Collection` removed** — Replace with `VectorCollection`, `GraphCollection`,
   `MetadataCollection`, or `AnyCollection` depending on your use case.
2. **`Database::get_collection()` removed** — Replace with `get_vector_collection()`,
   `get_graph_collection()`, `get_metadata_collection()`, or `get_any_collection()`.
3. **`AnyCollection` enum added** — For callers that don't know the collection type at compile
   time, use `db.get_any_collection(name)` and match on the variant.
4. **Python SDK unchanged** — The Python `Collection` class name and API are identical.
5. **Server REST API unchanged** — All HTTP endpoints behave identically.

### Refactored
- **Remove deprecated SIMD distance types** — `SimdDistance`, `NativeSimdDistance`, and
  `AdaptiveSimdDistance` removed from `index::hnsw::native::distance`. All production code
  and tests now use `CachedSimdDistance` exclusively. Benchmarks migrated.
- **Remove deprecated `HnswMappings` module** — `mappings.rs` and `mappings_tests.rs` deleted.
  Superseded by `ShardedMappings` since v1.6.0.
- **Tauri types consolidation** — `SearchResult` is now a type alias for
  `velesdb_core::api_types::SearchResultResponse`. Module-level documentation added explaining
  the camelCase/collection-field constraints that require Tauri-specific request types.
- **Project cleanup** — Removed 79 completed EPIC directories, 9 obsolete planning documents,
  outdated audit reports, and stale research notes. Remaining docs: architecture reference,
  roadmap strategy, EPIC-036 (mobile SDK), and internal process docs.

## [1.12.0] - 2026-04-05

### Added
- **Cross-collection MATCH queries (Issue #495)** — `@collection` annotation on MATCH node patterns
  enables cross-collection graph queries. Syntax: `MATCH (p:Product@products)-[:STORED_IN]->(inv:Inventory@inventory)`.
  Results are enriched with payloads from annotated collections (alias-prefixed fields).
- **MATCH via `/query` endpoint** — MATCH queries can now be executed via `Database::execute_query`
  using `_collection` parameter or `SELECT ... FROM <collection> WHERE MATCH ...` syntax.
  Previously, MATCH was rejected at the Database level.
- **Cross-type JOIN tests** — VectorCollection JOIN MetadataCollection validated with BDD tests.
- **Graph API parity** — 7 new REST endpoints for complete graph operations:
  - `DELETE /collections/{name}/graph/edges/{id}` — remove edge by ID
  - `GET /collections/{name}/graph/edges/count` — total edge count
  - `GET /collections/{name}/graph/nodes` — list all node IDs
  - `GET /collections/{name}/graph/nodes/{id}/edges` — node edges with direction filter (in/out/both)
  - `GET/PUT /collections/{name}/graph/nodes/{id}/payload` — get/upsert node payload
  - `POST /collections/{name}/graph/traverse/parallel` — multi-source BFS traversal
  - `POST /collections/{name}/graph/search` — embedding similarity search on graph nodes
- **CLI graph commands** — `graph remove-edge`, `graph count`, `graph search`
- **REPL graph commands** — `.graph remove-edge`, `.graph count`, `.graph search`, `.graph store-payload`, `.graph get-payload`, `.graph nodes` with full help documentation
- **Core** — `GraphCollection::traverse_bfs_parallel()` for multi-source BFS with deduplication
- **OpenAPI** — all new graph endpoints registered in API documentation
- **Tests** — 238 BDD tests, 4447 lib tests, 13 new server tests

### Performance
- **Bitmap pre-filter for filtered search (#487)** — adaptive strategy selection based on
  real selectivity: full-scan brute-force for ≤1% selectivity, HNSW+bitmap for 1-30%,
  post-filter fallback for >30%. Eliminates massive over-fetching on selective filters
- **CSR graph traversal v2 (#491)** — CsrSnapshot with edge IDs + labels, ArcSwap lock-free
  adjacency, EdgePredicate pushdown (290ns for label-filtered BFS vs 3.4µs unfiltered = 12x),
  lazy CSR rebuild on read instead of every mutation
- **Bulk insert v2 pipeline (#488)** — DirectVectorWriter bypasses ShardedVectors overhead,
  AsyncIndexBuilder with background thread for deferred HNSW construction
- **`ComponentScores` optimization (#476)** — `SmallVec<[(&'static str, f32); 4]>` eliminates per-result heap allocation
- **Bitmap NEQ support** — `Neq` conditions now use universe bitmap subtraction
- **Secondary index backfill** — `create_index` scans existing payloads to populate the index
- **LIKE→BM25 fallback** — metadata-only LIKE queries use BM25 text index for candidate narrowing
- **Native batch edge loading** — `add_edges_batch` with single lock acquisition cycle (1M+ edges/s)
- **19 functions CC > 8 reduced to ≤ 8** — all non-SIMD functions now comply with Codacy CC ≤ 8

### Fixed
- **BFS dedup** — CSR and EdgeStore BFS no longer produce duplicate results for nodes
  reachable via multiple paths (diamond graph fix).
- **DISTINCT in early-return paths (#475)** — `SELECT DISTINCT` now applied in NOT-similarity and union query paths.
- **NEAR + MATCH + metadata filter (#474)** — co-occurring metadata filters no longer silently dropped in hybrid search.
- **`list_indexes` includes secondary indexes** — was only returning property/range indexes.
- **`rrf_k` propagated to `hybrid_search_with_filter` (#472)** — was hardcoded to 60.
- **CSR label filter** — edges with unresolvable labels now excluded when rel_type filter is active.
- **Cross-collection enrichment** — logs `tracing::warn` when `@collection` references a non-existent collection.
- **AsyncIndexBuilder drain in flush** — `flush()` and `flush_full()` now drain the AIB buffer into HNSW.
- **Tauri `drop_index`** — uses `require_vector_collection` instead of deprecated `require_collection`.
- **LangChain `filter=` kwarg** — backward-compatible alias restored alongside `metadata_filter=`.

### Changed (Breaking)
- **BFS cycle behavior** — BFS no longer re-emits already-visited nodes when a cycle closes.
  Code relying on duplicate entries for cycle detection must be updated.
- **`ComponentScores` type** — changed from `SmallVec<[(String, f32); 4]>` to `SmallVec<[(&'static str, f32); 4]>`.
  External code constructing `SearchResult` with custom component scores must use `&'static str` literals.
- **Python `relationship_types=` alias (#490)** — `traverse_bfs/dfs` now accept both `rel_types=` and `relationship_types=`.
- **CLI commands restructured** — flat commands (`velesdb list`) grouped into sub-commands (`velesdb collection list`).
- **License** — added Attribution clause for public-facing applications (visible link
  to velesdb.com required, Enterprise license waives requirement).
- **Rate limit** — increased default from 100 to 100K QPS for local-first deployment.

## [1.11.0] - 2026-03-31

### Added
- **VelesQL v3.6 — 15 new SQL statements** covering the full DDL/DML surface:
  - `SHOW COLLECTIONS` / `DESCRIBE COLLECTION` / `EXPLAIN` — introspection queries
  - `CREATE INDEX` / `DROP INDEX` — secondary index management
  - `ANALYZE` — collection statistics and health checks
  - `TRUNCATE` — collection data reset (including graph collections: nodes + edges)
  - `ALTER COLLECTION` — runtime configuration changes
  - `FLUSH` — explicit WAL flush (FULL / PARTIAL modes)
  - Multi-row `INSERT` — `INSERT INTO ... VALUES (...), (...), (...)`
  - `UPSERT` — `UPSERT INTO ... VALUES (...)`
  - `SELECT EDGES` — graph edge queries with source/target filters
  - `INSERT NODE` — graph node creation via VelesQL
- **Python `Database.execute_query()`** — full VelesQL execution from Python bindings
- **TRUNCATE on graph collections** — clears both nodes and edges in a single operation
- **203 BDD E2E tests** — comprehensive behavior-driven test coverage for all VelesQL features
- **27 DDL/DML lifecycle tests** — end-to-end pipeline tests for CREATE→INSERT→SELECT→DROP flows
- **14 hybrid BDD tests** — NEAR+filter, NEAR+BM25, multi-condition WHERE combinations
- **13 BDD regression tests** — covering all Devin Review bug fix scenarios

### Fixed
- **Grammar word-boundary lookahead** — `COLLECTION` keyword no longer matches as prefix
  of identifiers (e.g., `collection_name` was incorrectly split)
- **WITH clause storage option propagation** — `CREATE COLLECTION ... WITH (storage='mmap')`
  now correctly passes storage mode to collection creation
- **Vocabulary consistency** — "collection" terminology used everywhere, never "table"
- **CI coverage reporting** — Codacy coverage reporter properly configured with API token auth
- **Test badge accuracy** — reflects real workspace total (5,495 tests incl. 203 BDD)

### Refactored
- **Cyclomatic complexity ≤ 8** — reduced CC across 6 hotspots (`extract_delete_fields`,
  `extract_delete_edge_fields`, and 4 others) for Codacy compliance
- **Tauri query routing** — aligned with server architecture for consistent DML/DDL handling
- **BDD test structure** — reorganized into `tests/bdd/` module for maintainability
- **VelesQL spec v3.6** — complete spec rewrite with 206 unit tests + 83 conformance tests

### Documentation
- **VelesQL spec v3.6** — full rewrite covering all 15 new statements with examples
- **4 obsolete reference files removed** — cleaned stale VelesQL docs, fixed all dead links
- **Archive notices updated** — migration guides point to current version

## [1.10.0] - 2026-03-29

### Fixed
- **WITH options silently ignored** — `WITH (mode='accurate')`, `WITH (timeout_ms=5000)`,
  and `WITH (rerank=true)` were parsed but never executed. Now all WITH options are wired
  to their respective execution paths via new `QuerySearchOptions` struct
- **USING FUSION ignored for NEAR+text MATCH** — Hybrid vector+text queries always used
  hardcoded RRF k=60 with equal weights. `USING FUSION (strategy='rrf', k=10, vector_weight=0.8)`
  now configures both k parameter and weights in the text hybrid path
- **WITH options ignored on NEAR+metadata filter path** — `search_with_filter()` bypassed
  quality mode. New `search_with_filter_and_opts()` applies quality-aware HNSW search
  with post-filtering when both filter and mode/ef_search are present
- **LET bindings silently discarded for MATCH queries** — `LET x = 0.5 MATCH ...` now
  returns a clear error instead of silently ignoring the bindings

### Added
- **Component scores in SearchResult** — `SearchResult.component_scores` tracks individual
  `vector_score`, `bm25_score`, `graph_score`, `sparse_score` independently. Enables
  `ORDER BY 0.7 * vector_score + 0.3 * bm25_score DESC` with real per-component values
  instead of all variables resolving to the same fused score
- **Hybrid search preserves component contributions** — `hybrid_search()` now records
  individual vector RRF and BM25 RRF contributions alongside the fused score
- **LET clause for named score bindings** — `LET hybrid = 0.7 * vector_score + 0.3 * bm25_score`
  defines reusable score variables available in SELECT and ORDER BY. Supports arithmetic
  expressions, chained bindings, and all score variables. Grammar rule, AST, parser,
  and execution fully wired. 7 conformance cases (P053-P059)
- **Agent Memory VelesQL bridge** — `AgentMemory::query_semantic()`, `query_episodic()`,
  `query_procedural()` enable VelesQL queries on agent memory collections. All three
  subsystems (`_semantic_memory`, `_episodic_memory`, `_procedural_memory`) are queryable
  with standard VelesQL: vector NEAR, payload filters (timestamp, confidence), ORDER BY,
  WITH options. Thin delegation to Collection::execute_query_str()

### Refactored
- **Split Phase: execute_query_with_client()** — CC reduced from 12 to 8 by extracting
  `prepare_query_context()` (pre-checks, timeout override, validation) and
  `finalize_query_results()` (guardrails, post-processing, stats update)
- **Replace Parameter with Object** — All search dispatch functions now accept
  `&QuerySearchOptions` instead of individual `ef_search: Option<usize>` parameter,
  enabling mode/rerank/fusion to flow through all 5 dispatch paths
- **DRY: component score tagging** — `tag_vector_component_scores()` and
  `attach_rrf_components()` centralize score tagging across all search paths

## [1.9.3] - 2026-03-29

### Fixed
- **OFFSET clause not executed** — `SELECT ... OFFSET N` was parsed but never applied;
  now applied after ORDER BY, before LIMIT in select_dispatch. Execution fetches
  `limit + offset` rows so `LIMIT 10 OFFSET 5` correctly returns 10 rows
- **MATCH start-node discovery** — `find_start_nodes()` only enumerated vector storage
  IDs, missing graph-only nodes (payload-only); now unions both ID sources
- **CLI rejected MATCH queries** — `Database::execute_query()` requires a FROM clause
  that MATCH lacks; CLI now routes MATCH through `Collection::execute_query()` using
  the active collection context (`.use <name>`)
- **tauri-plugin lost aggregation results** — `query()` always called `execute_query()`
  even for GROUP BY/HAVING; now detects aggregation queries and routes to
  `execute_aggregate()`, populating `column_data` in the response
- **mobile SDK stripped payloads** — `SearchResult` only had `{id, score}`; added
  optional `payload` field, populated from `point.payload` in `query()` results

### Added
- **Python GraphCollection VelesQL methods** — `query()`, `match_query()`, `explain()`,
  `query_ids()` now available on `GraphCollection` (previously only on `Collection`)
- **GraphCollection.execute_match() delegates** — Core delegates to inner Collection
  for both `execute_match()` and `execute_match_with_similarity()`
- **Python type stubs** — Complete `__init__.pyi` stubs for all GraphCollection methods
  including VelesQL query, graph operations, and schema management
- **Python MATCH documentation** — README section with label-based matching, hybrid
  similarity, and EXPLAIN usage examples
- **Server MATCH API docs** — README section documenting `POST /collections/{name}/match`
  endpoint with request/response examples
- **11 integration tests** — `test_graph_collection_match.py` covers MATCH traversal,
  label/relationship filtering, result structure, BFS/MATCH agreement

### Refactored
- **DRY: Python query helpers** — Extracted `build_explain_dict()` and
  `search_results_to_id_score()` as `pub(crate)` shared helpers, eliminating 53 lines
  of duplication between Collection and GraphCollection bindings

## [1.9.2] - 2026-03-28

### Fixed
- **Compaction crash safety** — WAL marker now written BEFORE in-memory state update,
  closing a crash window where recovery could miss a completed compaction
- **WASM StorageMode aliases** — `f32`, `int8`, `bit` aliases now recognized in WASM
  builds (previously only `full`, `sq8`, `binary` worked)
- **DistanceMetric alias "ip"** — `"ip"` (inner product) now accepted as an alias for
  DotProduct in all crates, matching existing server/Python behavior

### Added
- **Structured error codes in REST API** — Error responses now include an optional
  `code` field with VELES-XXX codes (e.g., `{"error": "...", "code": "VELES-004"}`).
  Backward-compatible: field absent when no structured code applies.
- **SearchQuality Custom/Adaptive** — Server now accepts `"custom:256"` and
  `"adaptive:32:512"` in the `mode` search parameter for fine-grained ef_search control
- **TypeScript SDK** — Added `SearchQuality` type (with `custom:N` and `adaptive:N:N`
  template literals), `quality` field in `SearchOptions`, `'relative_score'` fusion strategy
- **Startup update check** — Server and CLI now perform a non-blocking version check
  at startup (enabled by default). Sends only version/OS/arch/instance hash (no PII).
  Disable with `VELESDB_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1` or `[update_check] enabled = false` in config.

### Refactored
- **DRY: Centralized parsing** — `StorageMode` gains `FromStr`/`parse_alias()`/
  `canonical_name()` (like `DistanceMetric`). Five duplicate parsers replaced with
  single-line delegation across server, Python, WASM, Tauri, CLI
- **DRY: DistanceMetric delegation** — Three duplicate metric parsers (server, Python,
  Tauri) replaced with delegation to core `FromStr`
- **DRY: Filter parsing** — `Filter::from_json_value()` centralizes JSON filter
  deserialization used by server, Python, and Tauri
- **DRY: Test fixtures** — New `test_fixtures.rs` module centralizes collection setup
  and point creation across 12+ test files
- **File splits (NLOC compliance)** — `search.rs` (1,897 LOC) split into 4 modules
  (search, search_pools, search_state, search_tests). `repl_commands.rs` (1,520 LOC)
  split into 6 domain modules. `main.rs` (1,574 LOC) split into 3 modules (commands,
  cli_types, main)

### Performance
- **Zero-alloc cosine query normalization** — Thread-local buffer reuse eliminates
  per-search Vec allocation for cosine distance (6KB saved per 1536-dim query)
- **Eliminated double normalization** — Multi-entry search no longer re-normalizes
  an already-prepared query vector

## [1.9.1] - 2026-03-28

### Fixed
- **Devin review fixes**: Validate parameterized `similarity(field, $vec)` inside arithmetic
  expressions (new V008 error), recurse into Arithmetic for similarity context validation,
  add `graph_score`/`bm25_score` as built-in score variables, implement Display for
  ArithmeticExpr (human-readable output in Python/WASM SDKs)
- **Codacy complexity refactoring**: Extract 15+ helper functions to reduce cyclomatic
  complexity across 12 files (split_column_ref 15->5, parse_update_stmt 13->6,
  lifecycle::open 11->5, find_start_nodes 11->5, wal_append_upsert 11->5, and 7 more)
- Split `validation_types.rs` from `validation.rs` (508->383+212 NLOC)
- Split `crud_read_delete.rs` from `crud.rs` (579->321 NLOC)

## [1.9.0] - 2026-03-28

### Added
- **VelesQL ORDER BY arithmetic expressions** (#442): Support weighted score combinations
  like `ORDER BY 0.7 * vector_score + 0.3 * bm25_score DESC` with proper operator precedence,
  parenthesized expressions, and score variable resolution
- New `ArithmeticExpr` and `ArithmeticOp` AST types for ORDER BY expressions
- Conformance test cases P046-P052 for MATCH text and arithmetic ORDER BY
- `docs/guides/GRAPH_PATTERNS.md` practical guide for MATCH graph patterns

### Fixed
- **ORDER BY regression tests** (#443): Added 3 regression tests for ORDER BY on non-existent fields
- **MATCH text semantics documentation** (#444): Clarified that MATCH + NEAR performs hybrid RRF
  fusion (boost) rather than strict filtering; documented that MatchCondition.column is parsed but ignored
- **MATCH graph scope documentation** (#445): Documented single-collection limitation, _labels
  requirement, and edge store scope for graph pattern matching

### Changed
- `docs/reference/VELESQL_ORDERBY.md`: Updated score evaluation section to reference actual
  implementation (ScoreContext + evaluate_arithmetic), fixed feature status table
- `README.md`: Added clarifying note about MATCH graph operating within single collection
- Parser DRY refactor: extracted `parse_arithmetic_binary_chain` to eliminate duplication
  between additive and multiplicative parsing

## [1.8.0] - 2026-03-27

### Performance (Papers to Production)

## [1.7.2] - 2026-03-25

### Performance

- **HNSW Search Partial Sort** (#373) — `search_layer` now uses `select_nth_unstable_by` for O(n + k log k) candidate selection instead of full O(ef log ef) sort. Reduces wasted work when `ef_search` >> `k` (typical: ef=128, k=10). Shared `top_k_partial_sort` utility extracted to `index/mod.rs`, reused by both HNSW and BM25.
- **Batch Insert Fast-Path** (#375) — Eliminated ~14% overhead on pure-insert workloads introduced by v1.7.0 upsert semantics. New `register_or_replace_batch()` uses `contains_key()` (read lock) to skip the expensive `DashMap::entry()` write lock for new IDs. TOCTOU-safe with automatic fallback.
- **Upsert Lock Contention Elimination** — Three-part fix to eliminate lock serialization in `Collection::upsert()`:
  1. `trait_impl.rs`: Changed `self.inner.write()` to `self.inner.read()` for `HnswIndex::insert`. `NativeHnswInner::insert` takes `&self` and manages its own synchronization (per-node locks, atomic entry point); the outer write lock was unnecessarily serializing all inserts and blocking concurrent searches.
  2. `crud.rs`: Restructured `upsert_storage_and_index()` into a 3-phase pipeline — batch storage (1 fsync per storage), per-point secondary updates (no storage locks held), batch HNSW insert via `bulk_index_or_defer()`. Replaces per-point `insert_or_defer()` with a single batch call.
  3. `crud.rs`: Extracted `batch_store_all()` and `per_point_updates()` helpers for clear phase separation and minimal lock scope.

  Measured on i9-14900KF (10K vectors, 384D): upsert throughput rose from ~808 vec/s to ~16,151 vec/s, closing the gap with `upsert_bulk()` from 19x to ~1x. Regression tests added for batch upsert correctness and throughput parity.

### Backward Compatibility

No API changes. All three optimizations are internal and apply automatically.

**Note on HNSW graph construction order**: `insert_batch_parallel` and
`bulk_index_or_defer` now use rayon-based parallel graph insertion. Because
thread scheduling is non-deterministic, the resulting HNSW graph structure
may differ between runs for the same input data. This does not affect
correctness or recall — only the internal graph topology varies. If you
depend on byte-identical index files across builds (e.g., for reproducible
snapshots), use `insert_batch_sequential` (deprecated but deterministic).

## [1.7.1] - 2026-03-25

### Fixed

- **Security**: Validate collection names against path traversal — reject `../`, backslashes, special characters, and Windows reserved names. New error code VELES-034 (`InvalidCollectionName`). (#381)
- **Core**: Crash recovery gap detection for deferred HNSW indexer — vectors written to storage but not yet indexed in HNSW are automatically re-indexed on `Collection::open()`. (#382)
- **VelesQL**: Grammar bugs — `''` string escaping, N-ary compound queries (UNION/INTERSECT/EXCEPT chaining), vector literal integers `[1, 2, 3]`, `NOT IN` operator, version number alignment. **Note:** `CompoundQuery` AST struct shape changed (serde-breaking for external consumers serializing query ASTs; plan cache is unaffected). (#383)
- **VelesQL**: Fix plan cache invalidation for compound queries — `referenced_collection_names` now includes collection names from all UNION/INTERSECT/EXCEPT operands.
- **Docs**: VelesQL spec gaps — document `NEAR_FUSED` syntax and fusion strategies, fix FAQ INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE claims, correct API reference `FUSE BY` → `USING FUSION`, add conformance test cases. (#387)

## [1.7.0] - 2026-03-24

### Highlights

Minor release delivering **HNSW upsert semantics** (in-place vector update/replace), **complete GPU acceleration** (multi-metric wgpu pipelines with adaptive thresholds), **major batch insert optimizations** (chunked phase B, alloc/connect separation, ~2x throughput), and **search_layer batch SIMD** with deferred indexing. Includes critical fixes for batch rollback ordering, dimension validation, and Python binding re-entrancy.

### Features

- **HNSW Upsert Semantics** (#371) — Support vector update/replace with upsert semantics. Inserting a vector with an existing ID now replaces it in-place (HNSW graph reconnection + storage update) instead of requiring delete + reinsert. Applies to both single insert and batch operations.
- **Chunked Batch Insertion** (#364) — Implement chunked Phase B with inter-chunk entry point update. Large batches are split into optimal chunks (based on `compute_chunk_size()`), each chunk updates the global entry point for better graph connectivity. Extracted `bootstrap_entry_point()` and `finalize_batch()` as clean orchestration steps.
- **GPU Acceleration — Complete Multi-Metric Pipelines** (#358) — Full GPU acceleration across all distance metrics (cosine, euclidean, dot, hamming, jaccard) via wgpu compute shaders. Adaptive batch thresholds auto-tune GPU vs CPU dispatch. Multi-pipeline architecture with per-metric shader specialization.
- **Cyclomatic Complexity Tooling** (#354) — Added flake8 + cargo-complexity tooling for automated complexity monitoring.

### Performance

- **search_layer Batch SIMD + Deferred Indexing** (#366, #369) — Batch SIMD distance computation in HNSW search_layer replaces per-candidate evaluation. Deferred indexing postpones neighbor list updates during search for reduced lock contention. Combined improvement: ~15-20% search throughput gain.
- **Batch Insert Alloc/Connect Separation** (#362) — Separate allocation phase from connection phase in parallel batch insert. Pre-allocate all node slots, then connect in parallel without lock contention on the allocator. ~2x throughput improvement for large batches.

### Fixed

- **HNSW Batch Rollback Order** — Reverse batch rollback order for duplicate-ID correctness. Previously, forward-order rollback could leave orphaned graph edges when a batch contained duplicate IDs.
- **HNSW Dimension Validation** — Upfront dimension validation with index-aware rollback. Validates vector dimensions before upsert_mapping to prevent partial state on dimension mismatch.
- **HNSW insert_batch_sequential Rewrite** — Rewritten to per-item upsert semantics for consistency with single-insert behavior.
- **Python Import Mismatch & Re-entrant DB Lock** (#357, #356) — Resolved import path mismatch and re-entrant lock deadlock in Python bindings.
- **GPU Read Lock Starvation** — Release read lock before GPU dispatch to prevent write-starvation under concurrent load.
- **GPU alloc_zeroed UB** — Use `alloc_zeroed` instead of uninitialized allocation to prevent undefined behavior in GPU buffer setup.
- **Clippy Pedantic Warnings** (#368) — Resolved all remaining clippy pedantic warnings blocking CI.
- **Bench Recall Delta Display** (#364) — Multiply recall delta by 100 for correct percentage display in benchmark reports.

### Refactored

- **Code Duplication Elimination** (#345) — Systematic deduplication across codebase using Martin Fowler refactoring patterns. Extracted shared helpers, consolidated test setup, unified error handling.
- **HNSW Batch Orchestration** (#364) — Extracted `finalize_batch()`, `bootstrap_entry_point()`, and `compute_chunk_size()` from monolithic `parallel_insert`. Clean separation of concerns.
- **Post-Refactor Regression Fixes** (#345, #346) — Addressed regressions found by code review after the deduplication refactor.

### Documentation

- **README Revamp** (#352) — Complete README rewrite for developer conversion: problem statement, comparison table, quick start, VelesQL examples, architecture diagram, performance benchmarks.
- **Benchmark Performance Comparison** — Added PR #363+#365 performance comparison report with detailed analysis.
- **HNSW Invariant Comments** (#364) — Added invariant comments from code review for batch insertion code paths.

### Security

- **SAFETY Comments** (#353) — Added missing `// SAFETY:` comments for all `clippy::undocumented_unsafe_blocks` findings.
- **Codacy Cloud Resolution** (#342) — Resolved Codacy Cloud findings via targeted exclusions and Python security fixes.
- **LlamaIndex Edge ID Fix** (#344) — Renamed `add_edge` ID parameter and bumped security dependencies.

### Chore

- **Internal Documentation Cleanup** (#340) — Removed internal-only documentation from public repository.
- **Install Script Alignment** (#339) — Aligned install scripts with actual GitHub Release asset names.
- **VelesQL Contract Version** — Documentation updated from v2.1.0/v2.2.0 to v3.0.0 to match the runtime contract constant (`VELESQL_CONTRACT_VERSION`). The v3.0.0 contract was already shipped in code since v1.6.0 but documentation was lagging. No wire-protocol breaking changes — the version bump reflects accumulated parser features (SPARSE_NEAR, TRAIN QUANTIZER, enhanced JOIN/UNION support) that were already available.

## [1.6.0] - 2026-03-20

### Highlights

Major release delivering **production-grade server security** (API key auth, TLS, graceful shutdown), **massive code quality overhaul** (~150 Codacy complexity violations resolved), **storage reliability hardening** (atomic index swap, WAL replay, Windows crash recovery), **performance optimizations** (HNSW lock gating, LRU single-lock, FxHashMap edges, ContiguousVectors), and **full SDK feature parity** across Python, TypeScript, LangChain, and LlamaIndex. Includes migration tooling for Qdrant/Pinecone sparse vectors, 100K scalability benchmarks, and the VelesDB Core License 1.0.

### Features

- **API Key Authentication** (US-01) — Optional Bearer token auth for `velesdb-server`. Configure via `VELESDB_API_KEYS` env var or `[auth]` section in `velesdb.toml`. Multiple keys supported. Auth disabled by default (local dev mode). `/health` and `/ready` always bypass auth.
- **TLS Support** (US-02) — HTTPS via rustls. Configure with `VELESDB_TLS_CERT` / `VELESDB_TLS_KEY` or `[tls]` section in `velesdb.toml`. Plain HTTP remains the default.
- **Graceful Shutdown** (US-03) — SIGTERM/SIGINT triggers connection drain (30s timeout) + WAL flush before exit. Guarantees no data loss on clean shutdown.
- **Server Configuration Module** (US-04) — Unified `ServerConfig` loading from TOML + CLI + env with priority chain (CLI > env > TOML > defaults). Startup validation with clear error messages.
- **Readiness Endpoint** (US-05) — `GET /ready` returns 200 when DB is loaded, 503 during startup. `GET /health` now includes version field. Both bypass auth.
- **OpenAPI Security Scheme** (US-08) — OpenAPI spec now documents Bearer authentication via `securitySchemes`.
- **SDK Feature Parity** — 100% core features exposed across Python, LangChain, LlamaIndex, and TypeScript SDKs.
- **Migration: Sparse Vector Extraction** — Extract sparse vectors from Qdrant and Pinecone sources during migration.
- **100K Scalability Benchmark** — Weekly + push-to-main CI benchmark for 100K vector workloads.
- **Search Guardrails** — Rate limiting and circuit breaker enforced in all search handlers.
- **CLI Graph/Metadata Read** — Full collection read for Graph and Metadata types in REPL.

### Performance

- **Cosine SIMD finish optimization** — Replace `2×sqrt + div` with `dot / sqrt(na² × nb²)`, saves one `sqrtss` across AVX2, AVX-512, and NEON kernels. 768D: 34.0 ns → 33.6 ns (−1.2%).
- **Hamming AVX2 FP-domain accumulation** — Replace INT-domain pipeline with FP-domain `xor_ps → and_ps(1.0) → add_ps` to eliminate domain-crossing penalty on Intel P-cores. 768D: 36.0 ns → 34.3 ns (−4.7%).

- **HNSW lock optimizations** — Lock-rank gating, SIMD dispatch cleanup (Phases 1-2).
- **ContiguousVectors** — Replace `Vec<Vec<f32>>` with cache-friendly contiguous memory layout.
- **LRU single-lock get** — Eliminate double-locking on cache reads.
- **FxHashMap for edge_ids** — Faster graph edge lookup via hash-specialized map.
- **SIMD kernel optimizations** — Quantization and half-precision improvements (Phase 3).

  - **No Competitive Offering clause**: prohibits building competing databases, vector databases, graph databases, columnar stores, search engines, or query engines from VelesDB Core. Internal use, SaaS embedding, and backend integration remain permitted.
  - **Redistribution rules**: explicit permission for Docker images, package managers (Homebrew, apt, cargo), Helm charts, Terraform templates — with license inclusion, notice preservation, and same-license requirements.
  - **Benchmarking clause**: public benchmarks allowed with mandatory disclosure of methodology, dataset, hardware, software version, and configuration for transparency and reproducibility.
  - **Strengthened Hosted or Managed Service definition**: now covers indirect access through APIs, SDKs, gateways, middleware, service layers, application wrappers, proxy layers, webhooks, and message queues.
  - **Cloud provider protection**: explicit prohibition of DBaaS, managed clusters, hosted indexing/query platforms, and vector database as a service without a commercial license.
  - **Graph and ColumnStore coverage**: license now explicitly protects the graph database, knowledge graph engine, and columnar store capabilities — matching VelesDB's Vector + Graph + ColumnStore fusion architecture.
  - **Embedded/local-first clarification**: WASM, mobile (iOS/Android), Tauri desktop, and in-process embedded use expressly permitted.
  - **VelesQL coverage**: using VelesQL internally is permitted; exposing a general-purpose VelesQL endpoint to third parties requires a commercial license.
  - **Business model clarity**: explicit Core (source-available) / Enterprise (commercial) / Cloud (proprietary SaaS) tier structure for investor and acquirer readability.
  - **Expanded FAQ**: 24 developer-friendly Q&As covering RAG, SaaS embedding, API endpoints, cloud providers, MSPs, graph engine, embedded mode, premium features, VelesQL, benchmarks, and more.
  - **CLI moved to MIT** — `velesdb-cli` relicensed from VelesDB Core License 1.0 to MIT. Scope: `velesdb-core` and `velesdb-server` remain under VelesDB Core License 1.0; all SDKs, bindings, tools, integrations, examples, and demos are MIT.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-03-08

### Expert Rust Review Fixes

- **R-1 — `# Panics` documentation in SIMD dispatch** (`simd_native/dispatch/{cosine,dot,euclidean,hamming}.rs`):
  Added missing `# Panics` rustdoc sections to all four public dispatch functions documenting
  the dimension-mismatch panic contract. The `assert_eq!` guards are intentionally kept (not
  downgraded to `debug_assert_eq!`) because the project's `.cargo/config.toml` applies
  `-C opt-level=3` to all targets including tests, which would silently disable `debug_assert_eq!`
  and break the existing mismatch regression tests.
- **R-2 — `// SAFETY:` on non-unsafe code** (`fusion/strategy.rs`, `collection/query_cost/cost_model.rs`):
  Replaced all `// SAFETY:` comments on non-`unsafe` cast sites with `// Reason:`, following
  the project convention that `// SAFETY:` is reserved exclusively for `unsafe {}` blocks.
  Expanded justifications to include exact bounds and precision-loss acceptability rationale.
- **R-3 — Per-site cast annotations in `compaction.rs`** (`storage/compaction.rs`):
  Removed file-level `#![allow(clippy::cast_possible_truncation)]`. Each `as` cast site now
  carries a scoped `#[allow]` with a `// Reason:` comment explaining platform bounds
  (`usize == u64` on 64-bit, struct size fits u32, usize→u64 widens only).
- **R-4 — Idiomatic pointer casts** (`simd_neon_prefetch.rs`):
  Replaced `as *const u8` with `.cast::<u8>()` throughout (function body + module doc example).
  `.cast()` cannot accidentally change pointer mutability, avoids implicit clippy suppressions.
- **R-5 — File size refactoring** (300-line rule):
  Split three oversized files into focused modules:
  - `velesql/planner.rs` (572 → 339 lines): extracted `QueryStats` → `query_stats.rs` and
    `CostEstimator`/`Cost` → `cost_estimator.rs`; both re-exported via `pub use` in `planner.rs`.
  - `collection/search/query/mod.rs` (642 → 445 lines): extracted the large `match (vector_search,
    similarity, filter)` dispatch block into `dispatch_vector_query()` in `execution_paths.rs`.
  - `collection/core/crud.rs` (521 → 396 lines): extracted `cache_quantized_vector` and all
    secondary-index helpers into `crud_helpers.rs`. Zero API or behavioural change.
- **R-6 — `HnswIndex` stale `'static` lie doc removed** (`index/hnsw/index/mod.rs`):
  Updated struct-level, field-level, and `Drop` documentation to reflect the v1.0+ native
  implementation reality: `NativeHnswInner` owns all its data, no mmap borrowing occurs,
  no `'static` lifetime lie exists. `ManuallyDrop` and `io_holder` are retained for
  forward-compatibility with potential future backends, with this intent now clearly documented.

### Architecture Review Fixes

- **A-1 — Python bindings** (`velesdb-python/src/agent.rs`): Removed `unsafe { &*Arc::as_ptr(...) }`
  lifetime workaround from `PySemanticMemory`, `PyEpisodicMemory`, and `PyProceduralMemory`.
  `get_core_memory()` now passes `Arc::clone(&self.db)` directly to `new_from_db()`, matching
  the current `Arc<Database>` API. `AgentMemory::new` no longer double-opens the database.
- **A-2 — Tauri plugin state** (`tauri-plugin-velesdb/src/state.rs`): Changed `VelesDbState.db`
  from `Arc<RwLock<Option<Database>>>` to `Arc<RwLock<Option<Arc<Database>>>>`. `open()` now
  wraps the opened `Database` in `Arc`; `with_db()` passes `Arc<Database>` to its closure,
  making `SemanticMemory::new_from_db` call-sites in `commands.rs` compile without changes.
- **B-1 — Concurrency regression test** (`collection/core/crud_tests.rs`): Added
  `test_concurrent_upsert_and_search_no_deadlock` — 4 threads interleaving upserts and searches
  on a shared `Arc<Collection>` to guard against lock-ordering regressions.
- **C-1/C-2 — `update-check` feature gating** (`Cargo.toml`, `lib.rs`): `sha2`, `hex`,
  `hostname`, and `whoami` moved from unconditional target-scoped deps to optional deps gated
  behind the `update-check` feature. `pub mod update_check` and its re-exports in `lib.rs` now
  require `all(not(target_arch = "wasm32"), feature = "update-check")`.
- **D-1 — Agent doc example** (`agent/mod.rs`): Updated `//! # Example` to use
  `Arc::new(Database::open(...))` and `AgentMemory::new(Arc::clone(&db))` matching the current API.
- **D-2 — Similarity filter cast allows** (`collection/search/query/similarity_filter.rs`):
  Removed file-level `#![allow(cast_precision_loss/cast_possible_truncation)]`; both cast sites
  now carry scoped `#[allow(clippy::cast_precision_loss, clippy::cast_possible_truncation)]`
  with `// Reason:` comments.
- **D-3 — Query planner cast rationale** (`velesql/planner.rs`): Replaced `// SAFETY:` header
  (incorrect — not an unsafe block) with `// Reason:` covering all three cast types
  (`cast_precision_loss`, `cast_possible_truncation`, `cast_sign_loss`) with per-type bounds.
- **D-4 — Lock order annotations** (`collection/core/index_management.rs`): Added
  `// LOCK ORDER:` comments before dual-read-lock sites in `list_indexes()` and
  `indexes_memory_usage()` documenting the canonical `property_index → range_index` read order.
- **D-5 — Hybrid fusion TODO tracking** (`velesql/hybrid.rs`): Added `// TODO(EPIC-017):`
  comment above `#![allow(dead_code)]` to link the suppression to the integration epic.

- **Quantization SQ8** - Norm calculations use `simd_ops::norm()` (2-3x speedup)
- **Half-precision F32×F32** - All operations routed through `simd_ops`

#### Benchmark Results (5,000 vectors, 768D, Docker)

| Metric | pgvector | VelesDB | Result |
|--------|----------|---------|--------|
| **Insert + Index** | 8.54s | **2.63s** | **3.2x faster** |
| **Recall@10** | 100.0% | 99.7% | Comparable |
| **Search P50** | 3.0ms | 4.0ms | Comparable |

## Roadmap

Community roadmap and timelines live in [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md). LlamaIndex
integration, the Prometheus `/metrics` endpoint, Product Quantization, and
API-key authentication previously listed here have all shipped. The one item
still genuinely pending is:

- Unified documentation site (Astro/Starlight) — the reference docs currently
  ship as Markdown under `docs/`.

> Distributed replication, lock-free concurrent-WAL writes, and production
> RBAC / multi-tenant isolation are **VelesDB Enterprise** features (a separate
> product), not part of the open-source Community roadmap — see the
> "Scope & boundaries" section of the README.
