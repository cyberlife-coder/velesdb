"""Tests for scripts/check-deferred-removals.py.

The guard exists because `WalBatchConfig` was promised "at the next major" and
`v6.0.0` shipped two days later without it. So the test that matters is not that
the guard passes today — it does, trivially, because the due major has not
arrived — but that it **refuses** once it has. A gate nobody has seen fail is a
gate nobody knows is wired.
