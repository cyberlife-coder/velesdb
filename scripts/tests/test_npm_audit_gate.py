"""Behavioral contract for the npm advisories gate.

The gate exists because `npm audit` exits 1 for two unrelated events — an
advisory in the lockfile, and an advisory endpoint that never answered. During
the npmjs.org outage of 2026-09-03 the `npm advisories` job went red three
times on `develop` with the second event while reporting the first.

Every test here fails on the claim it names, not on an exception raised on the
way to it.
