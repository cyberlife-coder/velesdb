"""`CI Success` must actually depend on the jobs it lists.

The final ``ci-success`` job in ``.github/workflows/ci.yml`` gates merges
twice over, and the two halves are independent:

  * ``needs: [...]`` — makes the job RUN before ci-success and makes its
    status visible;
  * the ``[[ "${{ needs.X.result }}" == "success" ]]`` chain — makes a
    FAILURE of that job fail ci-success.

A job in ``needs`` but absent from the chain reports its red status on the PR
page and blocks nothing: ``if: always()`` means ci-success still runs, and an
unchecked result is simply never read. That is a gate you can watch fail while
the merge button stays green, and it is the same class of defect as
``doc-contract.yml`` never being in ``needs`` at all.

So the invariant is mechanical, not a checklist: every job in ``needs`` is
either read by the chain or listed in ``CHAIN_EXEMPT`` with its reason.

Deliberately regex-based, not PyYAML. ``gate-contracts.yml`` does now install
one pinned wheel, for ``test_local_ci``'s workflow reader — but this suite is
the guard that decides whether every OTHER guard can refuse, so it stays
buildable from the standard library alone. An import here would put the
meta-guard behind a PyPI fetch: an outage would then read as a red gate on a
clean tree, which is how this repository's npm gate came to be rewritten
(``gate-contracts.yml``, ``npm-audit``). The parsers are unit-tested
RED-then-GREEN on synthetic workflow text below before being pointed at the
real file.

    never `success`, so the chain fails however green everything else is.

    This bit in production on PR #2141. `python-integrations` admitted only
    `pull_request` and `push`, so a manual `workflow_dispatch` — the escape
    hatch this file's own comments name for the #1465 "required check is
    absent" failure mode — could only ever produce a RED `CI Success`. That is
    strictly worse than the hole it plugs: an absent check blocks a merge, a
    red one *replaces a green check-run of the same name* on the head SHA.
    Dispatch run 4378 overwrote the green verdict pull_request run 4380 had
    already recorded for the same commit.

    The rule is mechanical rather than a review habit: for every job the chain
    reads, the set of events its `if:` admits must cover every event the `on:`
    block declares. `sonarcloud` is out of scope by construction — it is in
    `needs` but deliberately absent from the chain (see CHAIN_EXEMPT), so it
    can skip freely.
