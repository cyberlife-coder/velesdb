#
# WHY DERIVED RATHER THAN COPIED
# ------------------------------
# A hand-copied list of commands drifts from CI, and the drift is silent: it
# shows up as a green local gate followed by a red CI. That happened —
# `cargo clippy -p velesdb-core --lib` passed while CI, which runs
# `--workspace --all-targets`, compiled the TEST code and refused. So this
# script reads the workflow's `run:` blocks; it does not know them.
#
# A step it cannot replay is ANNOUNCED, never dropped in silence: a gate
# skipped without saying so is worth less than a gate that is absent, because
# the operator believes it ran.
#
# JOBS defaults to every gate job, not just `lint`. The first version replayed
# `lint` alone and reported all-green on a tree that CI then failed on
# `hygiene` and `gate-contracts` — the very narrowness this tool exists to
# remove, reproduced inside it.
set -uo pipefail

# Overridable so the suite can point at a synthetic workflow and prove the
# gate list is DERIVED rather than copied.
