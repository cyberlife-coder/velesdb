//! What loading an index costs, and where that cost actually lands.
//!
//! Run with: `cargo bench --bench persistence_load_scale`
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! `persistence_save_scale` measures the write half of the round trip. This is
//! the read half, and it is the half #2173 was about: since #2215 a v2
//! `.vectors` is mapped as the graph's f32 arena instead of being deserialized
//! four bytes at a time. That change shipped with no figure attached, because
//! the save instrument builds its index in memory and therefore never adopts —
//! it cannot see the difference. This file is what makes the claim measurable.
//!
//! # The trap this benchmark exists to avoid
//!
//! **A mapped load does not read the vectors.** It maps them. The pages fault
//! in on first touch, which is a search, not the load call. So a benchmark that
//! times `load` alone reports the adopted path as nearly free and quietly moves
//! the cost outside its own measurement window — flattering, and wrong.
//!
//! Two groups therefore, and both matter:
//!
//! - `hnsw_load` — the load call alone. This is what a caller waits for before
//!   the index is usable, and on the adopted path it genuinely is faster.
//! - `hnsw_load_then_query` — the same load followed by a fixed set of
//!   searches. The deferred faults land inside this window, so it is the
//!   honest apples-to-apples comparison between mapping and copying.
//!
//! Quote the first only next to the second. A gain that appears in one and
//! vanishes in the other is a cost that moved, not a cost that went away.
//!
//! # Sweep dimension, not node count
//!
//! Loading reads `.vectors` and `.graph`. Only the first scales with
//! **dimension**; the graph scales with **node count**. Holding the node count
//! fixed and sweeping dimension therefore leaves the vector payload as the only
//! variable, which is the same reasoning `persistence_save_scale` documents and
//! the only way a difference is attributable to the arena at all.
//!
//! # What decides whether the load adopts
//!
//! Adoption needs a v2 file, a little-endian target, and a store of at least
//! `ContiguousVectors::MIN_ARENA_CAPACITY` vectors. The defaults below clear
//! that floor by a wide margin, but a configuration that does not would measure
//! the copy path while looking like it measured the mapped one — so keep the
//! node count well above it when changing the sizing.
//!
//! # What it measured, and what that number is NOT
//!
//! At 5 000 nodes, Euclidean, two runs per configuration, comparing `develop`
//! against the same tree with `adopt_durable_file` forced to `None`:
//!
//! | 3072d (58.6 MiB payload) | adopted | today's copy path |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `hnsw_load` | 2.0 / 5.7 ms | 106.5 / 97.7 ms |
//! | `hnsw_load_then_query` | 16.8 / 23.7 ms | 110.9 / 121.7 ms |
//!
//! **That ratio is not the value of mapping.** The copy path it is measured
//! against reads the payload with one `read_exact` per `f32` — 15.36 million
//! calls at this size, about 6.8 ns each, which is `BufReader` call overhead
//! rather than memory bandwidth. It is the read-side twin of the write-side
//! defect fixed in #2212, and it has not been fixed yet.
//!
//! The sibling instrument already measured what a bulk transfer of this exact
//! payload costs: 2 186 MiB/s, so roughly 27 ms for 58.6 MiB. A copy path
//! reading in bulk would land near that, against 16.8-23.7 ms adopted — close
//! to parity. **Most of the measured gap is the per-value read, not the
//! mapping.** Fixing that path and re-running this benchmark is what turns
//! these numbers into an answer about arenas.
//!
//! Three limits belong with the figures:
//!
//! - **Only warm page cache is measured.** The fixture is written immediately
//!   before the group and criterion re-runs on the same files, so every timed
//!   iteration reads the page cache. The "deferred faults" are minor faults,
//!   not disk I/O. Cold behaviour is likely *worse* for the adopted path than
//!   these numbers suggest, because `FileArena` advises `MADV_RANDOM` and so
//!   forgoes kernel readahead that the copy path's `BufReader` enjoys — and
//!   cold is exactly the case that justifies mapping on a constrained device.
//! - **Two runs are not a confidence interval.** The unpaired spread across
//!   these four points is 4.7x to 7.2x; pairing them is arbitrary at n=2.
//!   Criterion's own estimate over its samples is the figure to quote, and it
//!   is printed by the run.
//! - **32 searches do not touch every vector.** An HNSW query visits a subset,
//!   so this captures part of the deferred read. Subtract `hnsw_query_only` to
//!   separate the search compute from the load and its faults.
//!
//! # The decomposition, worked
//!
//! One adopted run at 5 000 x 3072d:
//!
//! | group | time |
//! |---|---|
//! | `hnsw_load` | 5.34 ms |
//! | `hnsw_query_only` | 16.11 ms |
//! | `hnsw_load_then_query` | 24.20 ms |
//!
//! Load plus its deferred faults is `24.20 - 16.11 = 8.09 ms`, of which the
//! load call is 5.34 ms — so the faults are roughly 2.7 ms. **The search
//! compute dominates the combined window**, which is why a ratio taken on
//! `hnsw_load_then_query` alone says more about HNSW than about arenas. That
//! is the arithmetic the control arm exists to make possible.
//!
//! # Sizing
//!
//! Defaults finish unattended. The payload has to dominate the graph-and-
//! sidecar constant before this instrument can arbitrate anything; on a machine
//! that is not idle that starts around 3072 dimensions, which is the calibration
//! `persistence_save_scale` records.
//!
//! ```text
//! VELESDB_LOAD_NODES=20000 \
//! VELESDB_LOAD_DIMS=768,3072 \
//! cargo bench --bench persistence_load_scale
//! ```
//!
//! Build time is sequential insertion and dominates the run: budget roughly a
//! minute per 200K nodes before any measurement starts.
