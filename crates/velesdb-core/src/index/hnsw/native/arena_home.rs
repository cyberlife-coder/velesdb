//! Where a graph's f32 arena lives on disk, and what becomes of it after.
//!
//! # When a graph gets a disposable arena, and when it does not
//!
//! The obvious design is to make the arena file *the* stored vectors — map
//! `{basename}.vectors` and skip deserialization entirely. Since #2173 that is
//! exactly what happens, but only when three things hold: the file is format
//! v2, so its payload starts page-aligned where [`FileArena`]'s data region
//! does; the target is little-endian, because `.vectors` is explicitly
//! little-endian while an arena file is native-endian raw memory; and the store
//! reaches `ContiguousVectors::MIN_ARENA_CAPACITY`, below which an arena is
//! sized up to that floor and the file would grow merely by being opened.
//!
//! **A graph that adopted `.vectors` holds no [`ArenaHome`] at all.** That is
//! the whole safety argument for this module after #2173: `Drop` here removes
//! its file unconditionally, so the way a durable store cannot be deleted by
//! accident is that no home is ever constructed for it — not a flag saying not
//! to. [`ArenaHome::claim`] reinforces it from the other side by building
//! `hnsw-{token}.arena` names and nothing else, so the two mechanisms cannot
//! meet even by mistake.
//!
//! Everything outside those three conditions still gets its own disposable
//! arena, deleted on drop: v1 files written before #2213, big-endian targets,
//! stores below the capacity floor, and any mapping the filesystem refuses. The
//! arena is then a cache of something already persisted, which is what makes
//! throwing it away free — `.vectors` remains the durable copy, and a reopened
//! collection builds a fresh arena from it.
//!
//! [`sweep_stale`](ArenaHome::sweep_stale) and
//! [`is_arena_file`](ArenaHome::is_arena_file) therefore keep their subject.
//! They exist so a sweep never eats `.vectors`, and disposable arenas still
//! exist to sweep.
//!
//! # What the disposable path costs
//!
//! Being a second copy is not free, and the cost is write volume rather than
//! space. Loading a collection writes every vector through the mapping, so
//! those pages are dirty; the kernel writes them back on its own schedule,
//! and then the file is deleted when the graph drops. The vector data is
//! therefore written to disk roughly **twice per collection lifetime** —
//! once into `.vectors`, once into an arena nobody will ever read again.
//!
//! Nothing here should try to hurry that along. An explicit `msync` would
//! only force the useless half of that writeback to happen sooner, spending
//! flash endurance to persist bytes already durable in `.vectors`; the pages
//! become reclaimable either way once the kernel has written them, which is
//! the property the resident-set argument actually needs.
//!
//! The trade is deliberate: on a memory-constrained device, spending write
//! bandwidth to move the f32 arena out of the resident set is usually worth
//! it, since that arena is the single largest thing a quantized index holds.
//! It is also why adoption is preferred wherever it applies — mapping
//! `{basename}.vectors` removes the duplicate entirely: no second copy, no
//! second write, no deletion.
//!
//! An earlier version of this doc called that "a format question, not an
//! architectural one". It was neither statement's fault that both turned out
//! wrong. Aligning the payload was a format change (#2213), but adopting the
//! file also moved *when* vector data becomes durable and *who* may delete it,
//! which is architecture — and the endianness the paragraph named was only one
//! of three conditions, the other two being page alignment and the capacity
//! floor. The reasoning is recorded on #2173 rather than repeated here.
