//! HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) index implementation.
//!
//! This module provides a high-performance approximate nearest neighbor
//! search index based on the HNSW algorithm.
//!
//! # Quality Profiles
//!
//! The index supports different quality profiles for search:
//! - `Fast`: `ef_search=64`, ~92% recall, lowest latency
//! - `Balanced`: `ef_search=128`, ~99% recall, good tradeoff (default)
//! - `Accurate`: `ef_search=256`, ~100% recall, high precision
//! - `Perfect`: `ef_search=2048`, 100% recall, maximum accuracy
//!
//! # Recommended Parameters by Vector Dimension
//!
//! | Dimension   | M     | ef_construction | ef_search |
//! |-------------|-------|-----------------|-----------|
//! | d ≤ 256     | 12-16 | 100-200         | 64-128    |
//! | 256 < d ≤768| 16-24 | 200-400         | 128-256   |
//! | d > 768     | 24-32 | 300-600         | 256-512   |

/// let index = HnswIndex::new(768, DistanceMetric::Cosine);

///
/// # Safety Invariants (Self-Referential Pattern)
///
/// When loaded from disk via [`HnswIndex::load`], this struct uses a
/// self-referential pattern where `inner` (the HNSW graph) borrows from
/// `io_holder` (the memory-mapped file). This requires careful lifetime
/// management:
///
/// 1. **Field Order**: `io_holder` must be declared AFTER `inner` so Rust's
///    default drop order drops `inner` first (fields drop in declaration order).
///
/// 2. **`ManuallyDrop`**: `inner` is wrapped in `ManuallyDrop` so we can
///    explicitly control when it's dropped in our `Drop` impl.
///
/// 3. **Custom Drop**: Our `Drop` impl explicitly drops `inner` before
///    returning, ensuring `io_holder` (dropped automatically after) outlives it.
///
/// 4. **Lifetime Extension**: We use `'static` lifetime in `HnswInner` which is
///    technically a lie - the actual lifetime is tied to `io_holder`. This is
///    safe because we guarantee `io_holder` outlives `inner` via the above.
///
/// **Note**: The `ouroboros` crate cannot be used here because `hnsw_rs::Hnsw`
/// has an invariant lifetime parameter, which is incompatible with self-referential
/// struct crates that require covariant lifetimes.
///
/// # Feature Flags (v0.8.12+)
///
/// - `native-hnsw` (default): Uses native HNSW implementation (faster, no deps)
/// - `legacy-hnsw`: Uses `hnsw_rs` library for compatibility
///
/// # Why Not Unsafe Alternatives?
///
/// - `ouroboros`/`self_cell`: Require covariant lifetimes (Hnsw is invariant)
/// - `rental`: Deprecated and unmaintained
/// - `owning_ref`: Doesn't support this pattern
///
/// The current approach is a well-documented Rust pattern for handling libraries
/// that return borrowed data from owned resources.
