/// Zero-copy guard for vector data from mmap storage.
///
/// This guard holds a read lock on the mmap and provides direct access
/// to the vector data without any memory allocation or copy.
///
/// # Performance
///
/// Using `VectorSliceGuard` instead of `retrieve()` eliminates:
/// - Heap allocation for the result `Vec<f32>`
/// - Memory copy from mmap to the new vector
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```rust,ignore
/// let guard = storage.retrieve_ref(id)?.unwrap();
/// let slice: &[f32] = guard.as_ref();
/// // Use slice directly - no allocation occurred
/// ```

/// Zero-copy guard for vector data from mmap storage.
/// Holds a read-lock on the mmap and validates that the underlying mapping
/// hasn't been remapped via an *epoch* counter.
///
/// # Epoch Validation
///
/// The guard captures the epoch at creation and validates it on each access.
/// If the mmap was remapped (epoch changed), access panics to prevent UB.
///
/// The epoch uses wrapping `u64` arithmetic. Overflow is theoretically possible
/// after 2^64 remaps (~584 years at 1B/sec) but practically irrelevant.

// SAFETY: VectorSliceGuard is Send+Sync because:
// 1. The underlying data is in a memory-mapped file (shared memory)
// 2. We hold a RwLockReadGuard which ensures exclusive read access
// 3. The pointer is derived from the guard and valid for its lifetime
// SAFETY: The guard enforces:
// * Lifetime tied to `_guard` (RwLockReadGuard) ⇒ mapping is pinned
// * Epoch check prevents access after remap
// The data is read-only, therefore Send + Sync are sound.
