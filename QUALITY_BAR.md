# VelesDB Quality Bar

This document specifies the **explicit, enforceable thresholds** below which VelesDB does not ship. Every release passes every gate, or the release is blocked.

These gates are not aspirational. They are enforced via CI workflows, scripts, and explicit pre-merge protocols. Each gate listed here links to its enforcement mechanism so that the gate can be inspected, contested, or extended publicly.

> **Last updated:** 2026-08-08 — applies to v4.x (workspace 4.3.0).

## TL;DR — the seven non-negotiable gates

| # | Gate | Threshold | Enforced by |
|---|------|-----------|-------------|
| 1 | **Recall@10** | ≥ 0.95 (10K, CI on search-path PRs) ; ≥ 0.90 (100K, manual `#[ignore]` test) | `cargo test test_recall` + the `perf-gate-e2e` job in `CI Success`; 100K floor run manually (see Gate 1) |
| 2 | **End-to-end search latency p50** | ≤ 450 µs (10K/384D, WAL ON, recall ≥ 96%) | `python benchmarks/velesdb_benchmark.py --recall` + perf-smoke CI gate |
| 3 | **No `.unwrap()` in production code** | Zero | `scripts/check_prod_unwraps.py` in CI |
| 4 | **No `unsafe` without `// SAFETY:` comment** | Zero | `scripts/verify_unsafe_safety_template.py` in CI |
| 5 | **Cyclomatic complexity** | ≤ 8 per function | Codacy Cloud (blocking) |
| 6 | **Function NLOC** | ≤ 50 | Codacy Cloud (blocking) |
| 7 | **Code duplication** | < 2% per language | jscpd in `scripts/local-ci.ps1` + Codacy |

A pull request that breaks any of these gates **cannot be merged**. There are no waivers without a documented exception added to this file.

**How "cannot be merged" is enforced:** both `develop` and `main` carry GitHub branch protection requiring the **`CI Success`** status check; force pushes are disabled on both branches. `CI Success` is a summary job, and the authoritative list of what it gates is its own `needs:` in [`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml) — read it there rather than trusting a copy. It currently stands at **26 jobs**: the build-and-test layer (lint, tests, security/cargo-deny, WASM, OpenAPI drift, VelesQL conformance, perf-smoke, the Python SDK and integrations, both Node binding suites) *and* the governance layer that polices this contract itself (`gate-contracts`, `doc-contract`, `promise-contract`, `mcp-doc-contract`, `production-gates`, `propagation-guard`, `binary-size`, `pr-governance`). This sentence used to enumerate eight of them, which read as the whole set and was not: the thirteen it omitted were, almost exactly, the guards. Gates 5–6 are enforced by Codacy Cloud; the official register of per-file complexity exceptions (each with a written rationale) is [`.codacy.yml`](.codacy.yml) — the bar is ≤ 8 / ≤ 50 everywhere outside that explicit whitelist. Gate 7 runs in `scripts/local-ci.ps1` and Codacy rather than as a GitHub Actions job.

## Gate 1 — Recall@10 ≥ 0.95

**Why:** A 5% recall drop on 10K vectors compounds catastrophically at production scale (1M+ vectors with the same drop becomes effectively unusable). Performance optimizations that silently degrade recall are the most dangerous regressions in a vector database.

**Enforcement:**

- **Local (mandatory before every PR touching the search path):**
  ```bash
  cargo test -p velesdb-core --features persistence test_recall -- --test-threads=1
  ```
  Must pass with recall ≥ 0.95 on 10K vectors.

- **CI (authoritative):**
  - The `perf-gate-e2e` job in [`ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml) (part of the required `CI Success` check) gates **recall@10 ≥ 0.95** on the 10K/384D benchmark for every PR touching the search hot path (also gates Gate 2's p50 — same job, single source of truth). [`perf-gate-e2e.yml`](.github/workflows/perf-gate-e2e.yml) re-validates recall at 100K scale nightly.
  - The 100K-vector ≥ 0.90 floor is a **manual** gate: the tests in
    [`crates/velesdb-core/tests/scale_recall_100k.rs`](crates/velesdb-core/tests/scale_recall_100k.rs)
    are `#[ignore]` (long-running) and are not wired into any CI workflow. Run them with:
    ```bash
    cargo test -p velesdb-core --test scale_recall_100k \
        --features persistence -- --ignored --nocapture --test-threads=1
    ```
  - The BDD suite enforces **per-metric recall coverage** via [`crates/velesdb-core/tests/bdd/recall_contract_multimetric.rs`](crates/velesdb-core/tests/bdd/recall_contract_multimetric.rs) (Cosine in `recall_contract.rs`, Euclidean and DotProduct in `recall_contract_multimetric.rs`) on every PR.

- **Documented modes:**

  | Mode | ef_search (base, current code) | Recall@10 (measured) |
  |------|-------------------------------|---------------------|
  | Fast | 96 (`max(96, k×3)`) | 92.2%* |
  | Balanced (default) | 160 (`max(160, k×5)`) | 98.8%* |
  | Accurate | 512 (`max(512, k×16)`) | 100.0% |

  Source: `benchmarks/results/2026-02-20-phase-e-report.md`; base values from
  `SearchQuality::ef_search` (`crates/velesdb-core/src/index/hnsw/params.rs`).
  \* measured at the former Fast=64 / Balanced=128 settings — the current
  higher bases can only match or improve those figures.

**When this triggers:** any change to `index/hnsw/`, `simd_native/`, `quantization/`, `fusion/`, or result-conversion code in Python bindings.

**See also:** [`docs/reference/KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md`](docs/reference/KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md).

---

## Gate 2 — End-to-end search latency p50 ≤ 450 µs

**Why:** This is the **canonical claim** in the README and in marketing material (Quick Comparison table). It is the full production path: VelesQL parse + plan + WAL fsync + HNSW search + recall ≥ 96%. We do not ship a release that breaks this number.

**Threshold:** 450 µs p50 on 10K vectors / 384D with WAL ON, measured on the i9-14900KF reference machine.

**Enforcement:**

- **CI gate (blocking — the `perf-gate-e2e` job in [`ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml), part of `CI Success`'s `needs:`):** runs `benchmarks/velesdb_benchmark.py --datasets 10000 --recall --json` on every PR that touches `crates/velesdb-core/src/{index,simd_native,quantization,fusion,wal,storage}/`, `crates/velesdb-python/`, or `benchmarks/velesdb_benchmark.py`. The recall@10 ≥ 0.95 bound (Gate 1) is gated at the contract threshold; the p50 bound is gated at a deliberately loose **1500 µs sanity floor** that catches order-of-magnitude algorithmic regressions without flaking on the ~3-4× slower GitHub-hosted runner. The canonical 450 µs claim itself is preserved by local + release-engineering measurement on the i9-14900KF reference machine.
- **Reproducible benchmark:** `python benchmarks/velesdb_benchmark.py --recall`
- **Source:** `CHANGELOG.md` v1.13.0 (measured 2026-03-27, baseline preserved through pre-seed remediation phases)
- **Promise contract:** [`docs/reference/promise-contract.json`](docs/reference/promise-contract.json) entry `readme_production_search_latency` enforces the exact substring `**450 us**` in `README.md`.

**Index-only micro-benchmarks** (separately measured, separately labeled in README):

| Component | Threshold | Reproduce |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| HNSW Search index-only (10K/768D, k=10) | ≤ 60 µs | `cargo bench -p velesdb-core --bench hnsw_benchmark` |
| SIMD Dot Product (768D, AVX2) | ≤ 25 ns | `cargo bench -p velesdb-core --bench simd_benchmark` |
| BM25 Sparse Search index-only (10K, top-10) | ≤ 70 µs | `cargo bench -p velesdb-core --bench sparse_benchmark` |

These are **not the same number** as the canonical 450 µs. The README explicitly disambiguates them since v1.13.3.

## Gate 3 — No `.unwrap()` in production code

**Why:** `.unwrap()` panics at runtime. A panic in a vector database means a process crash, which means data loss risk on writes and downtime on reads. We treat any production unwrap as a hard CI failure.

**Threshold:** Zero unwraps in any file outside `tests/`, `_tests.rs`, `benches/`, `examples/`, or any `#[cfg(test)]` block.

**Enforcement:**

- **CI script:** `scripts/check_prod_unwraps.py` — runs on every push, blocks merge if non-zero.
- **Crate coverage:** every production crate's `src/` — `velesdb-core`, `velesdb-server`, `velesdb-cli`, `velesdb-migrate`, `velesdb-mobile`, `velesdb-wasm`, `tauri-plugin-velesdb`, `velesdb-memory`, `velesdb-node`, `velesdb-python` (the last three were added per audit F-3.10). The scan set lives in `SCAN_DIRS`; add any new production crate there. Test modules gated by `#[cfg(test)]` **and** composite forms like `#[cfg(all(test, feature = "..."))]` are excluded (audit F-3.11).
- **Status:** **PASSED** — re-verified per push; the script exits 0 on the current workspace.

**Approved alternatives** (in order of preference):

| Instead of | Use | When |
|------------|-----|------|
| `.unwrap()` | `?` operator | Function returns `Result` or `Option` |
| `.unwrap()` | `.expect("invariant: <reason>")` | Value is guaranteed by logic, document why |
| `.unwrap()` | `.unwrap_or(default)` | Sensible default exists |
| `.unwrap()` | `.unwrap_or_else(\|\| ...)` | Default needs computation |

**Lock acquisition:** we use `parking_lot::RwLock` / `Mutex` exclusively. These never poison, so `.read()` / `.write()` / `.lock()` return guards directly with no `.unwrap()`.

---

## Gate 4 — Every `unsafe` block has a `// SAFETY:` comment

**Why:** `unsafe` is allowed only where it is necessary for performance (SIMD intrinsics, mmap, FFI). Every such block must be auditable: a maintainer reading the code in two years must understand why this is safe.

**Threshold:** Zero unsafe blocks without a corresponding `// SAFETY:` comment.

**Enforcement:**

- **CI script:** `scripts/verify_unsafe_safety_template.py` — runs on every push, blocks merge if any `unsafe { … }` / `unsafe impl …` site is not preceded by a `// SAFETY:` comment.
- **Crate coverage:** the CI `Verify SAFETY template` job validates changed production `.rs` files under **any** `crates/*/src/` — core and every binding (`velesdb-python`, `velesdb-wasm`, `velesdb-mobile`, `tauri-plugin-velesdb`, …). It was previously scoped to `velesdb-core` only, which let one incomplete template in `velesdb-python` slip past CI (audit F-3.12 / F-3.2).
- **Coverage:** every unsafe site in the workspace is annotated; live counts (unsafe sites and `// SAFETY:` comments) are reported by the script in CI logs and tracked release-over-release in `CHANGELOG.md`.
- **Audit trail:** [`docs/SOUNDNESS.md`](docs/SOUNDNESS.md) documents invariants for every unsafe pattern in the codebase.

**External audit:** Planned (Cure53 / independent Rust safety expert), conditional on funding.

---

## Gate 5 — Cyclomatic complexity ≤ 8

**Why:** Functions with CC > 8 are the leading source of bugs in any codebase (Fowler, *Refactoring*). We enforce the limit aggressively.

**Threshold:** Cyclomatic complexity ≤ 8 per function, all languages.

**Enforcement:**

- **Codacy Cloud (authoritative, blocking):** any PR introducing a function with CC > 8 fails the Codacy gate, blocks merge.
- **Local CLI (lizard, threshold > 15):** advisory, used during development.
- **Refactoring pattern:** Extract Function (Fowler #106) is the primary tool — if a fragment can be named, extract it.

---

## Gate 6 — Function NLOC ≤ 50

**Why:** Long functions hide complexity. A 50-NLOC ceiling forces helper extraction and improves testability.

**Threshold:** Function Non-comment Lines of Code ≤ 50.

**Enforcement:**

- **Codacy Cloud (authoritative, blocking):** PR fails if any new function exceeds 50 NLOC.
- **Exception:** Codacy `.codacy.yml` excludes test files (`_tests.rs`, `tests/`) from this rule because Arrange-Act-Assert blocks legitimately span more lines.

**Known violations (file NLOC > 500, file-level limit):**

| File | NLOC | Plan |
|------|------|------|
| `simd_native/x86_avx512.rs` | 1468 | Hard to split (intrinsics block); accepted exception |
| `simd_native/neon.rs` | 902 | Same as above |
| `velesdb-server/src/config.rs` | 837 | Refactor pending |
| `velesdb-migrate/src/pipeline.rs` | 806 | Refactor pending |

These are tracked but do not block release because they are SIMD intrinsics blocks (function-level NLOC is fine; file-level breach is unavoidable for hand-written intrinsics).

---

## Gate 7 — Code duplication < 2%

**Why:** DRY violations multiply maintenance cost. Each duplicated 50-token block becomes 2x the work for every future change.

**Threshold:** < 2% duplicated lines per language (Rust, Python, TypeScript).

**Enforcement:**

- **Local:** `npx jscpd --min-tokens 50 --reporters console --format rust crates/` — integrated in `scripts/local-ci.ps1`.
- **Codacy Cloud:** server-side check, blocking.

**Status:** enforced by Codacy Cloud on every PR; falling below the threshold blocks merge.

---

## Additional gates (advisory, not blocking)

These signals are tracked but do not block release individually:

| Signal | Threshold | Enforcement |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Test count | ≥ 7000 (Rust + TS + Py) | Not automated — checked manually from local test runs (no CI job counts tests) |
| BDD scenario coverage | All VelesQL syntax features | `crates/velesdb-core/tests/bdd/` |
| Doctest compilation | All `pub fn` doctests compile | `cargo test --doc` in CI |
| Promise contract sync | All numeric claims in README backed by benchmark commands | `scripts/check-promise-contract.py` in CI |
| Binary size | `velesdb-server` ≤ 12 MiB, `velesdb` (CLI) ≤ 10 MiB, `velesdb-migrate` ≤ 9 MiB (stripped release) | `scripts/check_binary_size.py` in CI (Binary Size Gate job) |
| TODO governance | Every TODO/FIXME/HACK carries an issue tag: `[EPIC-XXX/US-YYY]`, `(PREFIX-NNN)` (e.g. `(EPIC-001)`, `(US-GRAPH-01)`), `#123`, or `#issue` | `scripts/check-todo-annotations.py` |
| RUSTSEC | All advisories tracked or justified in `deny.toml` | `cargo deny check` in CI (Security Audit job) |
| Untrusted-input hardening | Corrupt/oversized persisted artifacts (HNSW graph, PQ codebook, sparse, BM25, WAL) are rejected at load, not used to size allocations; WAL `Fsync` is durable before ack; config limits validated in loaders + on open | Regression suites: `storage/storage_reliability_tests.rs`, `index/hnsw/persistence_atomicity_tests.rs`, `quantization/pq_tests.rs`, `quantization/rabitq_tests.rs`, `index/sparse/persistence_tests.rs`, `index/bm25_tests.rs`, `config_tests.rs`, `velesql/parser/robustness_tests.rs` (gated by `cargo test`) |

## Pre-release final checklist

Before tagging any release (patch, minor, major), all of the following must be **green**:

- [ ] Local: `cargo fmt --all -- --check`
- [ ] Local: `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --features persistence,gpu,update-check --exclude velesdb-python --exclude velesdb-node -- -D warnings -D clippy::pedantic` (then `cargo clippy -p velesdb-node --lib` and `PYO3_PYTHON=python3 cargo clippy -p velesdb-python --lib`, each `-D warnings` — both are excluded above for link reasons)
- [ ] Local: `cargo test --workspace --features persistence,gpu,update-check --exclude velesdb-python -- --test-threads=1`
- [ ] Local: `python scripts/check_prod_unwraps.py`
- [ ] Local: `python scripts/check-promise-contract.py`
- [ ] Local: `codacy-cli analyze` (via WSL on Windows)
- [ ] CI on `develop`: all jobs green for last 3 commits
- [ ] If search path touched: recall test ≥ 0.95
- [ ] If perf optimization: `python scripts/perf_phase_gate.py gate --phase <ID>` exit code 0 (manual tool — wired to no workflow; see `scripts/guards.json`)
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md updated with conventional commit subject groups
- [ ] All numeric claims in CHANGELOG/README updated in `promise-contract.json`
- [ ] Automated code review on the release PR: clean
- [ ] Codacy Cloud on the release PR: 0 blocking findings

The full checklist is automated in `.github/workflows/release.yml` after merge to `main` triggers tag publishing.

## How to propose changing this bar

The quality bar is intentionally hard to lower. To change a threshold:

1. Open a GitHub Discussion explaining why the current threshold is wrong (data, not opinion).
2. If the change relaxes a threshold, the discussion must include a **migration plan** to compensate (e.g. "we lower CC ≤ 8 to ≤ 10 in the SIMD module specifically, with an explicit `.codacy.yml` exception, because intrinsics block needs more branches").
3. If the change tightens a threshold, the discussion includes a **timeline for compliance** across the existing codebase.
4. The founder makes the final call. The decision is recorded in `CHANGELOG.md` under the relevant release.
